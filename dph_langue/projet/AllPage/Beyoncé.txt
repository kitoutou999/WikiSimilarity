That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record. 287 Production I am really passionate about all of the steps during the production ... I love to stack vocals and I love to create my own little Oreo with arrangements sometimes it can be thousands of vocals and then I go back and then kind of piece things together because usually the songs are way too long ... I go back and edit the structure of the song. I make sure that ... every section has an intention so that takes months. ... I hear certain elements of things that go with things that are opposites. I am rarely happy with one track its usually four or five things put together that again dont really go together. I am so excited when Im able to adjust the tempo and key and mute certain elements that dont complement and put opposites together. Sometimes its just like the EQ of a synth or the warmth of a bass or the distortion of a bass thats on a different song and I can hear like Ah! Thats exactly what is missing to make the track full and complete!

Once Ive committed I give it all of me. I start with identifying my intention and making sure that I am aligned with the collaborators for the same purpose. It takes enormous patience to rock with me. My process is tedious. I review every second of footage several times and know it backwards and forwards. I find every ounce of magic and then I deconstruct it. I keep building more layers and repeat this editing process for months. I wont let up until its undeniably reached its full potential. I believe my strength is understanding how storytelling music lighting angles fashion art direction history dance and editing work together. They are all equally important.
