Early life and acting background Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11 1974 in Los Angeles California. 1 He is the only child of Irmelin Indenbirken a legal secretary and George DiCaprio an underground comix artist and distributor. They met while attending college and moved to Los Angeles after graduating. 2 3 His mother is German and his father is of Italian and German descent. 4 His maternal grandfather Wilhelm Indenbirken was German 5 and his maternal grandmother Helene Indenbirken was a Russian immigrant living in Germany. 6 DiCaprio was raised Catholic . 7 Sources have falsely claimed his maternal grandmother was born in Odesa Ukraine; there is no evidence that DiCaprio has any relatives of Ukrainian birth or heritage. 8 DiCaprios parents named him Leonardo because his pregnant mother first felt him kick while she was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence Italy. 9 When DiCaprio was one year old his parents divorced after his father fell in love with another woman and moved out. 10 11 To raise him together his parents moved into twin cottages with a shared garden in Echo Park Los Angeles . 10 12 DiCaprios father lived with his girlfriend and her son Adam Farrar with whom DiCaprio developed a close bond. 13 DiCaprio and his mother later moved to other neighborhoods such as Los Feliz . 14 He has described his parents as bohemian in every sense of the word and as the people I trust the most in the world . 15 DiCaprio has stated that he grew up poor in a neighborhood plagued with prostitution crime and violence. 16 Attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years and later the Seeds Elementary School he later enrolled at the John Marshall High School . 17 18 DiCaprio disliked public school and wanted to audition for acting jobs instead. 16 He dropped out of high school later eventually earning a general equivalency diploma . 19 As a child DiCaprio wanted to become either a marine biologist or an actor. He eventually favored the latter; he liked impersonating characters and imitating people and enjoyed seeing their reactions to his acting. 20 According to DiCaprio his interest in performing began at the age of two when he went onto the stage at a performance festival and danced spontaneously to a positive response from the crowd. 21 He was also motivated to learn acting when Farrars appearance in a television commercial earned him 50 000. 22 DiCaprio has said in interviews that his first television appearance was in the childrens series Romper Room and that he was dismissed from the show for being disruptive. The shows host has denied that any children were removed from the show in this way. 23 24 At 14 he began appearing in several commercials for Matchbox cars which he calls his first role. 23 DiCaprio later appeared in commercials for Kraft Singles Bubble Yum and Apple Jacks . 25 In 1989 he played the role of Glen in two episodes of the television show The New Lassie . 26 At the beginning of his career DiCaprio had difficulty finding an agent. When he found one the agent suggested DiCaprio change his name to Lenny Williams to appeal to American audiences which he declined to do. 27 DiCaprio remained jobless for a year and a half although he had 100 auditions. Following this lack of success DiCaprio was going to give up acting but his father persuaded him to persevere. Motivated by his father and by the prospect of financial security he continued to audition. After a talent agent who knew his mothers friend recommended him to casting directors DiCaprio secured roles in about 20 commercials. 28 By the early 1990s DiCaprio began acting regularly on television starting with a role in the pilot of The Outsiders 1990 and one episode of the soap opera Santa Barbara 1990 in which he played a teenage alcoholic. 29 DiCaprios career prospects improved when he was cast in Parenthood a series based on the 1989 comedy film of the same name . To prepare for the role of Garry Buckman a troubled teenager he analyzed Joaquin Phoenix s performance in the original film. 30 His work that year earned him two nominations at the 12th Youth in Film Awards Best Young Actor in a Daytime Series for Santa Barbara and Best Young Actor Starring in a New Television Series for Parenthood . 31 Around this time he was a contestant on the childrens game show Fun House on which he performed several stunts including catching the fish inside a small pool using only his teeth. 32 33 Career 19911996: Early work and breakthrough DiCaprio made his film debut in 1991 as the stepson of an unscrupulous landlord in the low-budget horror sequel Critters 3 a part he later described as your average no-depth standard kid with blond hair . 34 DiCaprio has stated that he prefers not to remember Critters 3 viewing it as possibly one of the worst films of all time and the kind of role he wanted to avoid in the future. 35 Later in 1991 he became a recurring cast member on the sitcom Growing Pains playing Luke Brower a homeless boy who is taken in by the shows central family. 36 Co-star Joanna Kerns recalls DiCaprio being especially intelligent and disarming for his age but she noted that he was also mischievous and jocular on set and often made fun of his co-stars. 37 DiCaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to young female audience but his arrival did not improve the shows ratings and he left before the end of its run. 38 He was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Television Series. 39 DiCaprio also had an uncredited role in 1991 in one episode of Roseanne . 40 Lasse Hallstrom directed DiCaprio in Whats Eating Gilbert Grape 1993 for which he earned his first Academy Award nomination. In 1992 DiCaprio had a brief role in the first installment of the Poison Ivy film series 41 and was handpicked by Robert De Niro from a shortlist of 400 young actors to co-star with him in This Boys Life . Adapted from the memoir by Tobias Wolff the film focuses on the relationship between a rebellious teenager Toby DiCaprio and his mother Ellen Barkin and abusive stepfather De Niro. 23 42 43 Director Michael Caton-Jones said that DiCaprio did not know how to behave on set; accordingly Caton-Jones used a strict mentoring style after which DiCaprios behavior began to improve. 37 Bilge Ebiri of Rolling Stone found that the powerful bond between Barkin and DiCaprio elevated the film praising DiCaprios portrayal of his characters complex growth from a rebellious teen to an independent young man. 41 This Boys Life was the first film that gained him recognition. 44 DiCaprio played the developmentally disabled brother of Johnny Depp s character in Whats Eating Gilbert Grape 1993 a comedy-drama about a dysfunctional Iowa family. Caton-Jones recommended DiCaprio to director Lasse Hallstrom who was initially skeptical as he considered DiCaprio too good-looking for the part. Hallstrom cast DiCaprio after he emerged as the most observant auditionee. 34 37 To ensure authenticity in his portrayal DiCaprio studied similarly impaired children and their mannerisms and Hallstrom allowed him to create the character using his own researched attributes. 45 The film became a critical success. 46 At 19 DiCaprio earned a National Board of Review Award as well as nominations for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor making him the seventh-youngest Oscar nominee in the category. 47 48 The films real show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio wrote New York Times critic Janet Maslin who makes Arnies many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. The performance has a sharp desperate intensity from beginning to end. 49 Caryn James also writing for The New York Times said of his performances in This Boys Life and Whats Eating Gilbert Grape : He made the raw emotional neediness of those boys completely natural and powerful. 50 DiCaprios first role of 1995 was in Sam Raimi s Western The Quick and the Dead . When Sony Pictures became dubious over DiCaprios casting co-star Sharon Stone paid his salary herself. 51 The film was released to dismal box office performance and mixed reviews from critics. 52 53 DiCaprio next starred as a teenage Jim Carroll a drug-addicted high school basketball player and budding writer in the biopic The Basketball Diaries . 54 He starred in the erotic drama Total Eclipse 1995 driven by the desire to showcase an exceptional performance which would focus on his acting talent rather than his much-discussed physical appeal. 55 Directed by Agnieszka Holland it is a fictionalized account of the same-sex relationship between Arthur Rimbaud DiCaprio and Paul Verlaine David Thewlis . DiCaprio was cast when River Phoenix died before filming began. 10 Although the film failed commercially 56 it has been included in the catalog of the Warner Archive Collection which releases classic and cult films from Warner Bros. library on home video. 57 A review in the San Francisco Chronicle called DiCaprio his generations great acting promise but criticized the mismatch between Thewliss cultivated British accent and DiCaprios Southern California twang . 58 DiCaprio next starred opposite Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann s Romeo Juliet 1996 an abridged modernization of William Shakespeare s romantic tragedy which retained the original Shakespearean dialogue. DiCaprio was initially unsure about another Romeo and Juliet adaptation but at his fathers suggestion he agreed to examine Luhrmanns work more closely. DiCaprio and Luhrmann then spent a two-week workshop exchanging ideas which led to the collaboration. 59 Romeo Juliet established DiCaprio as a leading Hollywood actor; according to film scholar Murray Pomerance DiCaprios newfound popularity helped the film become profitable only days after its release. 60 61 Reviewing DiCaprios early works David Thomson of The Guardian called DiCaprio a revelation in Whats Eating Gilbert Grape very moving in This Boys Life suitably desperate in The Basketball Diaries and a vital spark in Romeo Juliet . 62 The latter earned DiCaprio a Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival . 63 He then portrayed a young man who has been committed to a mental asylum in Marvins Room 1996 a family drama about two estranged sisters played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton who are reunited through tragedy. He played Hank the troubled son of Streeps character. 64 Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly praised the deeply gifted DiCaprio for holding his own against veteran actresses Keaton and Streep describing the three as full-bodied and so powerfully affecting that youre carried along on the pleasure of being in the presence of their extraordinary talent . 65 19972001: Titanic and worldwide recognition Leo-mania redirects here. DiCaprio rejected a role in Boogie Nights 1997 to star opposite Kate Winslet in James Cameron s Titanic as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage. 66 DiCaprio initially had doubts but was eventually encouraged by Cameron to pursue the part. 67 With a production budget of more than 200 million 68 69 the film was the most expensive in history at the time and was shot at Rosarito Baja California where a replica of the ship was created. 70 Titanic became the highest-grossing film at the time eventually earning more than 2.1 billion in box-office receipts worldwide. a The role of Jack Dawson transformed DiCaprio into a superstar resulting in intense adoration among teenage girls and young women that became known as Leo-mania . 73 74 The film won 11 Academy Awards the most wins for any film including Best Picture but DiCaprios failure to gain a nomination led to a protest against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS by more than 200 fans. 75 76 He was nominated for other high-profile awards including a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor . 77 DiCaprio at a press conference for The Beach in 2000 DiCaprio stated in 2000: I have no connection with me during that whole Titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world ... Ill never reach that state of popularity again and I dont expect to ... Its not something Im going to try to achieve either. 78 In his 2015 Rolling Stone article Ebiri called the role DiCaprios best writing that he and Winslet infuse their earnest back-and-forth with so much genuine emotion that its hard not to get swept up in their doomed love affair. 41 A writer for Vanity Fair in 2008 similarly labeled them Hollywoods most iconic screen couple since Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman . 79 Essaying her first viewing of the film in 2017 Vox contributor Alissa Wilkinson took note of DiCaprios boyish charm and found his performance natural and unaffected . 80 The success of Titanic intensified DiCaprios standing as a teen idol and romantic lead an image from which he sought to dissociate himself. 74 He reduced his workload to learn to hear his own voice in choosing the roles that he wanted to pursue. 81 DiCaprio had a brief featured role in Woody Allen s 1998 satire of fame Celebrity . Ebiri labeled DiCaprio the best thing in the film . 41 82 That year he also took on the dual roles of villainous King Louis XIV and his secret sympathetic twin brother Philippe in Randall Wallace s The Man in the Iron Mask with common elements from the 1939 film of the same name and a 1929 film with Douglas Fairbanks . 83 It received mixed to negative reviews 84 but grossed 180 million against a budget of 35 million. 85 86 Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman wrote that DiCaprio did not look old enough to play the part but praised him as a fluid and instinctive actor with the face of a mischievous angel . 87 The Guardian s Alex von Tunzelmann was similarly impressed with the actors performance but found his talent wasted in the film. 88 DiCaprio won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple for the dual roles in 1999. 89 Also in 1998 DiCaprio was cast to star in American Psycho 2000 for a reported salary of 20 million; after disagreements with Oliver Stone on the films direction DiCaprio left the project taking the lead role in The Beach instead. 90 Adapted from Alex Garland s 1996 novel the film saw him play a backpacking American tourist who ends up in a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand . 91 Budgeted at 50 million the film earned almost three times that at the box office 92 but was negatively reviewed by critics and earned him a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor . 93 94 Todd McCarthy of Variety thought DiCaprio gave a compelling performance but his character lacked defining qualities. 95 The film received criticism for damaging the filming location in Thailand after which DiCaprio worked to restore the area. 96 In the mid-1990s DiCaprio agreed to be in the mostly improvised black-and-white short film Dons Plum as a favor to aspiring director R. D. Robb . 23 When Robb expanded it to a full-length film DiCaprio and co-star Tobey Maguire had its release blocked in the US and Canada by court order arguing they never intended to make a feature film. The film premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival but remains obscure. 97 20022009: Venture into film production See also: Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio and Appian Way Productions DiCaprio attending an event for Gangs of New York with Martin Scorsese and Cameron Diaz at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival DiCaprio turned down the role of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones 2002 feeling unprepared to take that dive at the time. 98 His first film that year was the biopic Catch Me If You Can based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr. who before his 19th birthday committed check fraud to make millions in the 1960s. 99 Directed by Steven Spielberg the film was shot across 147 different locations in 52 days making it the most adventurous super-charged movie-making DiCaprio had experienced yet. 100 The film received critical acclaim and grossed 355 million against a budget of 52 million becoming his second highest-grossing release after Titanic . 101 102 Roger Ebert praised his departure from dark and troubled characters 99 and two Entertainment Weekly critics in 2018 called it DiCaprios best role labeling him delightfully persuasive deceptive flirtatious and sometimes tragicand we dare you to find a better role if you can . 103 DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film. 104 Also in 2002 DiCaprio starred in Martin Scorsese s Gangs of New York a historical drama set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in starring in the film and thus Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by overshooting of budgets and producer-director disagreements resulting in an eight-month shoot. With a budget of 103 million the film was the most expensive Scorsese had ever made. DiCaprio was drawn to playing Amsterdam Vallon the young leader of an Irish-American street gang as it marked a shift from boyish roles to a mature leading man. 105 Gangs of New York earned 193 million worldwide and received positive critical response. 106 107 Anne Thompson of The Observer took note of DiCaprios low-key sturdy performance but felt that co-star Daniel Day-Lewis overshadowed him. 108 In 2004 DiCaprio founded the production company Appian Way Productions a namesake of the Italian road . 109 He was interested in finding unique source material and preserving its essence during development citing previous experiences where the involvement of too many people influenced the final product in a negative way. 110 DiCaprio first executive-produced The Assassination of Richard Nixon which starred Sean Penn as Samuel Byck 40 and was screened at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival . 111 DiCaprio and Scorsese reunited for a biopic of Howard Hughes an American film director and aviation pioneer suffering from obsessivecompulsive disorder in The Aviator 2004 which DiCaprio also co-produced under Appian Way.

In Scorseses The Departed DiCaprio played the role of Billy Costigan a state trooper working undercover in the Irish Mob in Boston someone he characterizes as being in a constant 24-hour panic attack . DiCaprio especially liked the experience of working with co-star Jack Nicholson describing a scene with him as one of the most memorable moments of his life as an actor. 118 In preparation he visited Boston to interact with people associated with the Irish Mob and gained 15 pounds 6.8 kg of muscle. 119 Critically acclaimed 120 the film grossed 291 million against a budget of 90 million becoming DiCaprio and Scorseses highest-grossing collaboration to that point. 121 102 Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised DiCaprios and co-star Matt Damon s performances as explosive emotionally complex but felt that Nicholson overshadowed the two. 122 Despite DiCaprios leading role in The Departed the films distributor Warner Bros. Pictures submitted his performance for a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the AMPAS to avoid internal conflict with his part in Blood Diamond . 123 Instead his co-star Mark Wahlberg was nominated though DiCaprio earned other accolades for The Departed including a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor nominations at the Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards. 124 DiCaprio at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival In Blood Diamond DiCaprio starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who is involved in the Sierra Leone Civil War .

He played one of three agents battling a terrorist organization in the Middle East. 134 Considering the film to be a throwback to political features of the 1970s like The Parallax View 1974 and Three Days of the Condor 1975 DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role. 134 The film received mixed reviews from critics 135 and grossed 118 million against a budget of 67.5 million. 136 Later in 2008 DiCaprio collaborated with Kate Winslet for the drama Revolutionary Road directed by her then-husband Sam Mendes . As both actors had been reluctant to make romantic films similar to Titanic it was Winslet who suggested that they both work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 eponymous novel by Richard Yates . She found that the script by Justin Haythe had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster. 137 Playing a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s DiCaprio and Winslet spent some time together in preparation and DiCaprio felt claustrophobic on the small set they used. 79 138 He saw his character as unheroic slightly cowardly and someone willing to be just a product of his environment . 139 Peter Travers liked DiCaprios pairing with Winslet and his multi-layered portrayal of an overwhelmed character 140 and Marshall Sella of GQ called it the most mature and memorable performance of his lifetime . 138 DiCaprio earned his seventh Golden Globes nomination for the film. 141 Revolutionary Road grossed 75.9 million against its budget of 35 million. 142 He ended the 2000s by producing director Jaume Collet-Serra s psychological horror thriller film Orphan 2009 starring Vera Farmiga Peter Sarsgaard and Isabelle Fuhrman .

He played Edward Teddy Daniels a U.S. Marshal investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island who comes to question his own sanity. DiCaprio and Scorsese became interested in the project in 2007 and the former co-produced the film under Appian Way with Phoenix Pictures . 144 Because of the films disturbing scenes DiCaprio had nightmares of mass murder during production and considered relaxing with his friends a form of therapy. 145 The film was released to mixed reviews; 146 Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised Scorseses direction and the acting but criticized its twist ending. 147 Peter Travers called it DiCaprios most haunting and emotionally complex performance yet and particularly liked his cave scene with co-star Patricia Clarkson . 148 The film was a commercial success grossing 294 million worldwide against a budget of 80 million. 149 DiCaprio first from the right with the cast of Inception at the films premiere in 2010 DiCaprios second role in 2010 was in Christopher Nolan s critically acclaimed ensemble science-fiction film Inception . 150 Inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation 151 the film features Dom Cobb DiCaprio an extractor who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate targets mind. 152 DiCaprio was fascinated with the idea of a dream-heist and the potential for his character to manipulate his dreamworld and impact his real life. 153 Made on a budget of 160 million the film grossed 836 million worldwide to become DiCaprios second highest-grossing film. 102 154 To star in this film DiCaprio agreed to a pay cut from his 20 million fee and opted for a share in first-dollar gross points which entitled him to a percentage of the cinema ticket sales. The risk proved fruitful as DiCaprio earned 50 million from the film becoming his highest payday yet. 155 DiCaprio starred as J. Edgar Hoover in Clint Eastwood s J. Edgar 2011. A biopic about Hoover the film focuses on his career as an FBI director including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual. 156 Critics felt that the film lacked coherence overall but commended DiCaprios performance. 157 158 Roger Ebert praised DiCaprios ability to bring depth and nuance to the character suggesting that his performance conveyed aspects of Hoovers personality that were possibly even unknown to the man himself. 159 Also in 2011 he produced Catherine Hardwicke s romantic horror film Red Riding Hood . Though it was named one of the ten worst films of 2011 by Time magazine 160 it had moderate box-office returns. 161 Also that year DiCaprios Appian Way produced George Clooney s political drama The Ides of March an adaptation of Beau Willimon s 2008 play Farragut North . 162 In 2012 DiCaprio starred as plantation owner Calvin Candie in Quentin Tarantino s Spaghetti Western Django Unchained . After reading the script DiCaprio felt uncomfortable with the extent of racism portrayed in the film but his co-stars and Tarantino convinced him not to sugarcoat it. 163 While filming DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand on glass but continued filming and Tarantino elected to use the take in the final product. 164 The film received critical acclaim; 165 a writer for Wired magazine commended him for playing a villainous role and found his performance blood-chilling . 166 The film earned DiCaprio a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. 167 Django Unchained grossed 425 million worldwide on a production budget of 100 million. 168 In January 2013 DiCaprio said he would take a long break from acting to fly around the world doing good for the environment . 169 That year he had four releases as an actor and a producer.

That performance just broke my heart. 263 Other ventures Activism Climate change is real it is happening right now.
