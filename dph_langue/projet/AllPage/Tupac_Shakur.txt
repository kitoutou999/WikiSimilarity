Philipss 2002 article also alleges the involvement of Christopher Notorious B.I.G. Wallace and several within New York Citys criminal underworld. Both Anderson and Wallace denied involvement while Wallace offered a confirmed alibi. 245 unreliable source? Music journalist John Leland in The New York Times called the evidence inconclusive . 246 In 2011 via the Freedom of Information Act the FBI released documents related to its investigation which described an extortion scheme by the Jewish Defense League classified as a right wing terrorist group by the FBI 247 that included making death threats against Shakur and other rappers but did not indicate a direct connection to his murder. 248 249 On July 18 2023 the Las Vegas Police Department executed a search warrant in connection with Shakurs murder. 250 On September 29 2023 the AP reported that Las Vegas police had arrested a suspect Duane Keefe D Davis in Shakurs murder.

Moreover Shakurs artistic sensibilities were enriched by his passion for theater and admiration for the works of William Shakespeare . Notably he honed his theatrical skills as a student at the Baltimore School for the Arts where he delved into the psychological complexities inherent in inter-gang warfare and inter-cultural conflicts reflecting themes explored in Shakespearean dramas. 1 2Pacalypse Now 1991 showcased his socially conscious perspective. Through powerful tracks like Brendas Got a Baby Trapped and Part Time Mutha Shakur addressed social injustice poverty and police brutality. In doing so he contributed to the ongoing success of rap groups such as Boogie Down Productions Public Enemy X-Clan and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five while establishing himself as one of the pioneering socially conscious rappers from the West Coast. 11 Continuing his focus on the social challenges faced by African American people Shakurs second album featured songs like The Streetz R Deathrow and Last Wordz .

For instance the head voice involves singing high-pitched tones resonating from the head while the chest voice utilizes the chest area. In the documentary Tupac Shakur: Thug Angel Greg Shock G Jacobs one of Shakurs early producers discusses how rappers also utilize different bodily areas to project their voices. According to him Slick Rick rhymed from the nasal palate Nas from the back of his throat and Pac from the pit of his stomach which is where his power came from. Shakurs influences stemmed from powerful orators like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X . Despite not being physically imposing Shakurs voice carried immense weight and power reminiscent of these influential speakers. Shakur was also known for his technique of stacking or layering vocals adding depth and rawness to his voice. This approach demonstrated notably on tracks like Dear Mama from his 1995 album Me Against the World involves overlaying multiple vocal lines to highlight rhythms and emphasize words and phrases. Mastering this technique requires precision to maintain flow and clarity as heard in the lyrics and even though I act crazyI gotta thank the Lord that you made me where Shakurs voice transitions from full to husky underscoring the emotional depth of the lyrics. Despite its difficulty Shakurs background in jazz poetry and theater endowed him with exceptional rhythm control enabling him to layer vocals seamlessly while preserving cohesion and flow. 255 Legacy and remembrance A statue of Shakur at the MARTa museum in Herford Germany Shakur is considered one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. 256 257 He was listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by Rolling Stone . 258 He is widely credited as an important figure in hip hop culture and his prominence in pop culture in general has been noted. 259 Dotdash formerly About.com while ranking him fifth among the greatest rappers nonetheless notes Tupac Shakur is the most influential hip-hop artist of all time.

People either try to emulate him in some way or they go in a different direction because they didnt like what he did. But whatever you think of him he definitely developed his own style: He didnt sound like anyone who came before him. 269 According to music journalist Chuck Philips Shakur had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form setting the stage for the current global hip-hop phenomenon. 270 Philips writes The slaying silenced one of modern musics most eloquent voicesa ghetto poet whose tales of urban alienation captivated young people of all races and backgrounds. 270 Via numerous fans perceiving him despite his questionable conduct as a martyr the downsizing of martyrdom cheapens its use academic Michael Eric Dyson concedes. 271 But Dyson adds Some or even most of that criticism can be conceded without doing damage to Tupacs martyrdom in the eyes of those disappointed by more traditional martyrs. 271 In 2014 BET explained that his confounding mixture of ladies man thug revolutionary and poet has forever altered our perception of what a rapper should look like sound like and act like. In 50 Cent Ja Rule Lil Wayne newcomers like Freddie Gibbs and even his friend-turned-rival B.I.G. its easy to see that Pac is the most copied MC of all time. There are murals bearing his likeness in New York Brazil Sierra Leone Bulgaria and countless other places; he even has statues in Atlanta and Germany. Quite simply no other rapper has captured the worlds attention the way Tupac did and still does. 272 More simply his writings published after his death inspired rapper YG to return to school and get his GED. 261 In 2020 former California Senator and current vice-president Kamala Harris called Shakur the best rapper alive which she explained as being because West Coast girls think 2Pac lives on . 273 274 According to writer Kevin Powell : He deserves to be put in the same category as Bob Dylan Bob Marley as John Lennon in terms of his global impact. 275 Tupac is regarded as one of the most influential artists in music and popular culture in general and an icon of activism. 7 Palestinian rapper Tamer Nafar leader and a founding member of DAM became passionate about hip hop by listening to Tupac saying The imagery in Shakurs videos was similar to our reality in Lod. 276 Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation In 1997 Shakurs mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation.

Yet in Shakurs terrible sense of urgency Price identified instead a quest to unify mind body and spirit. 283 According to Price Tupac had surpassed the legacies of John Coltrane and Mahalia Jackson within the tradition of black music. 284 In 2012 the Norwegian University of Oslo organized the course: Tupac hiphop og kulturhistorie Tupac hip hop and cultural history.
