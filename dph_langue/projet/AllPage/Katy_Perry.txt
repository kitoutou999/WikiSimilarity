Growing up she attended religious schools and camps including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years . 2 8 The family struggled financially 9 sometimes using food stamps and eating food from the food bank which also fed the congregation at her parents church. 10 Growing up Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the word luck reminded their mother of Lucifer and were also required to call deviled eggs angeled eggs . 11 Perry primarily listened to gospel music 12 as secular music was generally discouraged in the familys home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. 13 Perry later recalled a story about how a friend of hers played You Oughta Know by Alanis Morissette which impacted her songwriting and singing. 14 While not strictly identifying as religious she has stated I pray all the time for self-control for humility. 15 Wanting to be like her sister Angela Perry began singing by practicing with her sisters cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of her parents who let her take vocal lessons like Angela was doing at the time. She began training at age nine 16 and was incorporated into her parents ministry 3 singing in church from ages nine to 17. 17 At 13 Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday 3 18 and publicly performed songs she wrote. 9 She tried to be a bit like the typical Californian girl while growing up and started rollerskating skateboarding and surfing as a teenager.
