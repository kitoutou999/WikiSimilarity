Regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation and his music and stagecraft has had a significant impact on popular music . Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with local bands and a self-titled solo album 1967 before achieving his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart with Space Oddity 1969. After a period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust . The character was spearheaded by the success of Starman and its album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars both 1972 which won him widespread popularity. In 1975 Bowies style shifted towards a sound he characterised as plastic soul initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering his first major US crossover success with the number-one single Fame and the album Young Americans both 1975. In 1976 Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station . In 1977 he again changed direction with the electronic -inflected album Low the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the Berlin Trilogy . Heroes 1977 and Lodger 1979 followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single Ashes to Ashes its album Scary Monsters and Super Creeps and Under Pressure a 1981 collaboration with Queen . He achieved his greatest commercial success in the 1980s with Lets Dance 1983. Between 1988 and 1992 he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles including industrial and jungle . He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence 1983 Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth 1986 Phillip Jeffries in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me 1992 Andy Warhol in the biopic Basquiat 1996 and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige 2006 among other film and television appearances and cameos. He ceased touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. He returned from a decade-long recording hiatus in 2013 with The Next Day and remained musically active until his death from liver cancer in 2016. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album Blackstar . During his lifetime his record sales estimated at over 100 million worldwide made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time . He is the recipient of numerous accolades including six Grammy Awards and four Brit Awards . Often dubbed the chameleon of rock due to his constant musical reinventions he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest singers songwriters and artists of all time. As of 2022 Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century. Early life David Robert Jones was born on 8 January 1947 in Brixton London. 2 His mother Margaret Mary Peggy nee Burns 3 was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton Kent. 4 Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester . 5 She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells . 6 His father Haywood Stenton John Jones 3 was from Doncaster Yorkshire 7 and worked as a promotions officer for the childrens charity Barnardos . The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth . Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded childand a defiant brawler. 8 From 1953 Bowie moved with his family to Bickley and then Bromley Common before settling in Sundridge Park in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School. 9 His voice was considered adequate by the school choir and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder . At the age of nine his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations vividly artistic and his poise astonishing for a child. 10 The same year his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers the Platters Fats Domino Elvis Presley and Little Richard . 11 12 Upon listening to Little Richards song Tutti Frutti Bowie later said that he had heard God . 13 Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to Hound Dog soon after its release in 1956. 12 According to Kristina she and David danced like possessed elves to records of various artists. 14 By the end of the following year Bowie had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artiststo his local Wolf Cub group was described as mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet . 12 Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler in the late 1950s Davids father took him to meet singers and other performers preparing for the Royal Variety Performance introducing him to Alma Cogan and Tommy Steele . 14 After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School . 15 It was an unusual technical school as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote: Despite its status it was by the time David arrived in 1958 as rich in arcane ritual as any English public school . There were houses named after eighteenth-century statesmen like Pitt and Wilberforce . There was a uniform and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages science and particularly design where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton . In Davids account Frampton led through force of personality not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither and yielded the schools most gifted pupils to the arts a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son Peter to pursue a musical career with David a partnership briefly intact thirty years later. 15 Bowies maternal half-brother Terry Burns was a substantial influence on his early life. 16 Burns who was 10 years older than Bowie had schizophrenia and seizures and lived alternately at home and in psychiatric wards; while living with Bowie he introduced the younger man to many of his lifelong influences such as modern jazz Buddhism Beat poetry and the occult . 17 In addition to Burns a significant proportion of Bowies extended family members had schizophrenia spectrum disorders including an aunt who was institutionalised and another who underwent a lobotomy ; this has been labelled as an influence on his early work. 16 Bowie studied art music and design including layout and typesetting. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a Grafton saxophone in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross . 18 19 He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation 20 his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and anisocoria a permanently dilated pupil which gave a false impression of a change in the iris colour erroneously suggesting he had heterochromia iridum one iris a different colour to the other; his eye later became one of Bowies most recognisable features. 21 Despite their altercation Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood who went on to create the artwork for Bowies early albums. 22 Music career 19621967: Early career to debut album A trade ad photo of Bowie in 1967 Bowie formed his first band the Konrads in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members Underwood among them. 23 When Bowie left the technical school the following year he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electricians mate. Frustrated by his bandmates limited aspirations Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles and make another million. Bloom did not respond to the offer but his referral to Dick James s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowies first personal management contract. 24 Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. His debut single Liza Jane credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees was not commercially successful. 25 26 Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin Wolf and Willie Dixon covers Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys another blues outfit who incorporated folk and soul I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger he recalled. 24 Their cover of Bobby Bland s I Pity the Fool was no more successful than Liza Jane and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third a blues trio strongly influenced by the Who . Youve Got a Habit of Leaving fared no better signalling the end of Conns contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world to study mime at Sadlers Wells Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager Ralph Horton later instrumental in his transition to solo artist helped secure him a contract with Pye Records . Publicist Tony Hatch signed Bowie on the basis that he wrote his own songs. 27 Dissatisfied with Davy and Davie Jones which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees he took on the stage name David Bowie after the 19th-century American pioneer James Bowie and the knife he had popularised . 28 29 30 His first release under the name was the January 1966 single Cant Help Thinking About Me recorded with the Lower Third. 31 It flopped like its predecessors. 32 Bowie departed the Lower Third after the singles release partly due to Hortons influence 31 and released two more singles for Pye Do Anything You Say and I Dig Everything both of which featured a new band called the Buzz before signing with Deram Records . 26 Around this time Bowie also joined the Riot Squad ; their recordings which included one of Bowies original songs and material by the Velvet Underground went unreleased. Kenneth Pitt introduced by Horton took over as Bowies manager. 33 His April 1967 solo single The Laughing Gnome on which speeded-up and high-pitched vocals were used to portray the gnome failed to chart. Released six weeks later his album debut David Bowie an amalgam of pop psychedelia and music hall met the same fate. It was his last release for two years. 34 In September Bowie recorded Let Me Sleep Beside You and Karma Man both rejected by Deram and left unreleased until 1970. The tracks marked the beginning of Bowies working relationship with producer Tony Visconti which with large gaps lasted for the rest of Bowies career. 35 36 19681971: Space Oddity to Hunky Dory Studying the dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dellarte Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison his composition Over the Wall We Go became a 1967 single for Oscar ; another Bowie song Silly Boy Blue was released by Billy Fury the following year. 37 Playing acoustic guitar Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk Merseybeat poetry and mime. 38 After the break-up with Farthingale Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger. 39 In February and March 1969 he undertook a short tour with Marc Bolan s duo Tyrannosaurus Rex as third on the bill performing a mime act. 40 Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale Bowie joined forces with Finnigan Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street. 39 The club was influenced by the Arts Lab movement developing into the Beckenham Arts Lab and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park the subject of his song Memory of a Free Festival . 41 Plaque at Trident Studios in London marking where Bowie recorded six albums between 1969 and 1974 Pitt attempted to introduce Bowie to a larger audience with the Love You till Tuesday film which went unreleased until 1984. 42 Feeling alienated over his unsuccessful career and deeply affected by his break-up Bowie wrote Space Oddity a tale about a fictional astronaut named Major Tom . 43 44 45 The song earned him a contract with Mercury Records and its UK subsidiary Philips who issued Space Oddity as a single on 11 July 1969 five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch. 43 Reaching the top five in the UK 46 it was his first and last hit for three years. 47 Bowies second album followed in November. Originally issued in the UK as David Bowie it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name and the US release was instead titled Man of WordsMan of Music ; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by RCA Records as Space Oddity . Featuring philosophical post- hippie lyrics on peace love and morality its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock the album was not a commercial success at the time. 48 49 50 Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediatehe wrote his 1970 single The Prettiest Star for her 51 and her involvement in his career far-reaching leaving Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating. 48 Having established himself as a solo artist with Space Oddity Bowie desired a full-time band he could record with and could relate to personally. 52 The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar. Known as Hype the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars. After a disastrous opening gig at the London Roundhouse they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist. 52 53 Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latters drumming style leading to his replacement by Mick Woodmansey . 54 Not long after Bowie fired his manager and replaced him with Tony Defries . This resulted in years of litigation that concluded with Bowie having to pay Pitt compensation. 54 The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowies third album The Man Who Sold the World 1970 which contained references to schizophrenia paranoia and delusion. 55 It represented a departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by his second album 56 to a more hard rock sound. 57 58 Mercury financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour across the US in which Bowie between January and February 1971 was interviewed by media. Exploiting his androgynous appearance the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted Bowie wearing a dress. He took the dress with him and wore it during interviews to the approval of critics including Rolling Stone s John Mendelsohn who described him as ravishing almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall . 59 60 Bowie and Tony Defries at Andy Warhols Pork at Londons Roundhouse in 1971 During the tour Bowies observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed producing the ultimate pop idol . 59 A girlfriend recalled his scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character who looks like hes landed from Mars . 59 The Stardust surname was a tribute to the Legendary Stardust Cowboy whose record he was given during the tour. Bowie later covered I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship on 2002s Heathen . 61 Hunky Dory 1971 found Visconti supplanted in both roles by Ken Scott producing and Trevor Bolder on bass. It again featured a stylistic shift towards art pop and melodic pop rock 62 with light fare tracks such as Kooks a song written for his son Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones born on 30 May. 63 Elsewhere the album explored more serious subjects and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with Song for Bob Dylan Andy Warhol and Queen Bitch the latter a Velvet Underground pastiche. 64 His first release through RCA 65 it was a commercial failure 66 partly due lack of promotion from the label. 67 Peter Noone of Hermans Hermits covered the albums track Oh! You Pretty Things which reached number 12 in the UK. 68 19721974: Glam rock era Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust Tour 1972 Dressed in a striking costume his hair dyed reddish-brown Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars Ronson Bolder and Woodmanseyat the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth in Kingston upon Thames on 10 February 1972. 69 The show was hugely popular catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating as described by David Buckley a cult of Bowie that was uniqueits influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom. 69 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars 1972 combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory was released in June and was considered one of the defining albums of glam rock . Starman issued as an April single ahead of the album was to cement Bowies UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song. The album which remained in the chart for two years was soon joined there by the six-month-old Hunky Dory . At the same time the non-album single John Im Only Dancing and All the Young Dudes a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople 70 were successful in the UK. The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States. 71 Bowie contributed backing vocals keyboards and guitar to Reeds 1972 solo breakthrough Transformer co-producing the album with Ronson. 72 The following year Bowie co-produced and mixed the Stooges album Raw Power alongside Iggy Pop. 73 His own Aladdin Sane 1973 was his first UK number-one album. Described by Bowie as Ziggy goes to America it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. Aladdin Sane spawned the UK top five singles The Jean Genie and Drive-In Saturday . 74 75 Bowies love of acting led to his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. Offstage Im a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. Its probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David. With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardustand later the Thin White Dukefrom his own character offstage. Ziggy Bowie said wouldnt leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity. 76 His later Ziggy shows which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronsons guitar. 77 Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage retirement at Londons Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. 78 Footage from the final show was incorporated for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars which premiered in 1979 and commercially released in 1983. 79 Ziggy Stardust Sample of Ziggy Stardust 1972. A pioneer of glam rock Bowie performed as the character Ziggy Stardust backed by the Spiders from Mars. Problems playing this file? See media help . After breaking up the Spiders Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought after: The Man Who Sold the World had been re-released in 1972 along with Space Oddity . Hunky Dory s Life on Mars? was released in June 1973 and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart . Entering the same chart in September his 1967 novelty record The Laughing Gnome reached number six. 80 Pin Ups a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites followed in October producing a UK number three hit in his version of the McCoys s Sorrow and itself peaking at number one making Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six. 81 19741976: Plastic soul and the Thin White Duke Bowie performing Rebel Rebel on TopPop in February 1974 Bowie moved to the US in 1974 initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. 82 Diamond Dogs 1974 parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post- apocalyptic city and setting George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty-Four to music. 83 The album went to number one in the UK spawning the hits Rebel Rebel and Diamond Dogs and number five in the US. The supporting Diamond Dogs Tour visited cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob . The resulting documentary Cracked Actor featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with his slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction producing severe physical debilitation paranoia and emotional problems. 84 He later commented that the accompanying live album David Live ought to have been titled David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory . 85 David Live nevertheless solidified Bowies status as a superstar charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US. It also spawned a UK number ten hit in a cover of Eddie Floyd s Knock on Wood . After a break in Philadelphia where Bowie recorded new material the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. 86 Bowie performing on the Diamond Dogs Tour July 1974 The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was Young Americans 1975. Sandford writes Over the years most British rockers had tried one way or another to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now. 87 The albums sound which Bowie identified as plastic soul constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. 88 Young Americans was a commercial success in both the US and the UK and yielded Bowies first US number one Fame a collaboration with John Lennon . 89 A re-issue of the 1969 single Space Oddity became Bowies first number-one hit in the UK a few months after Fame achieved the same in the US. 90 He mimed Fame and his November single Golden Years on the US variety show Soul Train earning him the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the programme. 91 The same year Bowie fired Defries as his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute he watched as described by Sandford millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered in what were uniquely generous terms for Defries then shut himself up in West 20th Street where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door. 92 Michael Lippman Bowies lawyer during the negotiations became his new manager; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when he was fired the following year. 93 Bowie performs with Cher on the variety show Cher 1975. Station to Station 1976 produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin 94 introduced a new Bowie persona the Thin White Duke of its title track . Visually the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film The Man Who Fell to Earth the same year. 95 Developing the funk and soul of Young Americans Station to Station s synthesiser-heavy arrangements were influenced by electronic and German krautrock . 96 94 Bowies cocaine addiction during this period was at its peak; he often did not sleep for three to four days at a time during Station to Station s recording sessions and later said he remembered only flashes of its making. 97 His sanityby his own later admissionhad become twisted from cocaine; 84 he referenced the drug directly in the albums ten-minute title track. 98 The albums release was followed by a 3 1 2 -month-long concert tour the Isolar Tour of Europe and North America. The core band that coalesced to record the album and tourrhythm guitarist Carlos Alomar bassist George Murray and drummer Dennis Davis continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s. Bowie performed on stage as the Thin White Duke. 99 96 Bowie as the Thin White Duke at Maple Leaf Gardens Toronto 1976 The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader and was detained by customs on the RussianPolish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia. 100 Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the Victoria Station incident . Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute which was captured on camera and published in NME . Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. 101 He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his cocaine addiction the character of the Thin White Duke 102 and his life living in Los Angeles a city he later said should be wiped off the face of the Earth . 103 He later apologised for these statements and throughout the 1980s and 1990s criticised racism in European politics and the American music industry. 104 Nevertheless his comments on fascism as well as Eric Clapton s alcohol-fuelled denunciations of Pakistani immigrants in 1976 led to the establishment of Rock Against Racism . 105 19761979: Berlin era Main article: Berlin Trilogy Apartment building at Hauptstrae 155 Schoneberg Berlin where Bowie lived from 1976 to 1978 In August 1976 Bowie moved to West Berlin with his old friend Iggy Pop to rid themselves of their respective drug addictions and escape the spotlight. 106 107 108 Bowies interest in German krautrock and the ambient works of multi-instrumentalist Brian Eno culminated in the first of three albums co-produced with Visconti that became known as the Berlin Trilogy . 109 110 The album Low 1977 was recorded in France and took influence from krautrock and experimental music and featured both short song-fragments and ambient instrumentals. 111 112 Before its recording Bowie produced Iggy Pops debut solo album The Idiot described by Pegg as a stepping stone between Station to Station and Low . 113 Low was completed in November but left unreleased for three months. RCA did not see the album as commercially viable and was expecting another success following Young Americans and Station to Station . 114 115 Bowies former manager Tony Defries who maintained a significant financial interest in Bowies affairs had tried to prevent the album from being released. 106 Upon its release in January 1977 Low yielded the UK number three single Sound and Vision and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart where it reached number two. 116 Bowie himself did not promote it 106 instead touring with Pop as his keyboardist throughout March and April before recording Pops follow-up Lust for Life . 117 Heroes Sample of Heroes 1977. One of the ambient rock songs to emerge from Bowies Berlin Trilogy era Heroes gained lasting popularity. Problems playing this file? See media help . Echoing Low s minimalist instrumental approach the second of the trilogy Heroes 1977 incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent seeing Bowie joined by guitarist Robert Fripp . 118 It was the only album recorded entirely in Berlin. 119 Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators synthesisers and koto the album was another hit reaching number three in the UK. Its title track was released in both German and French and though only reached number 24 in the UK singles chart later became one of his best-known tracks. 120 In contrast to Low 121 Bowie promoted Heroes extensively performing the title track on Marc Bolans television show Marc and again two days later for Bing Crosby s final CBS television Christmas special when he joined Crosby in Peace on EarthLittle Drummer Boy a version of The Little Drummer Boy with a new contrapuntal verse. 122 RCA belatedly released the recording as a single five years later in 1982 charting in the UK at number three. 117 123 Bowie performing in Oslo Norway 1978 After completing Low and Heroes Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; Buckley writes that Isolar II was Bowies first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends. 124 Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage released the same year. 125 Bowie also recorded narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev s classical composition Peter and the Wolf which was released as an album in May 1978. 126 127 The final piece in what Bowie called his triptych Lodger 1979 eschewed the minimalist ambient nature of its two predecessors making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music in places incorporating Hijaz non-Western scales . Some tracks were composed using Enos Oblique Strategies cards: Boys Keep Swinging entailed band members swapping instruments Move On used the chords from Bowies early composition All the Young Dudes played backwards and Red Money took backing tracks from The Idiot s Sister Midnight . 128 129 The album was recorded in Switzerland and New York City. 130 Ahead of its release RCAs Mel Ilberman described it as a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer shunned and victimized by lifes pressures and technology.

Its three singles became top 20 hits in both countries where its title track reached number one. Modern Love and China Girl each made number two in the UK accompanied by a pair of absorbing music videos that Buckley said activated key archetypes in the pop world... Lets Dance with its little narrative surrounding the young Aboriginal couple targeted youth and China Girl with its bare-bummed and later partially censored beach lovemaking scene... was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV . 149 Then-unknown Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan guested on the album featuring prominently on the title track. 150 151 Lets Dance was followed by the six-month Serious Moonlight Tour which was extremely successful. 152 At the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards Bowie received two awards including the inaugural Video Vanguard Award . 153 Tonight 1984 another dance-oriented album found Bowie collaborating with Pop and Tina Turner .

Bowie later described it as his nadir calling it an awful album . 161 He supported the album on the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour . 162 The backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar.

Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art : locked in Clos des Mesanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature and started work on an autobiography. 327 One of Bowies paintings sold at auction in late 1990 for 500 328 and the cover for his 1995 album Outside is a close-up of a self-portrait he painted that year. 329 His first solo show titled New AfroPagan and Work: 19751995 was in 1995 at The Gallery in Cork Street London. 330 In 1997 he founded the publishing company 21 Publishing whose first title was Blimey! From Bohemia to Britpop: London Art World from Francis Bacon to Damien Hirst by Matthew Collings . 329 A year later Bowie was invited to join the editorial board of the journal Modern Painters 331 and participated in the Nat Tate art hoax later that year. 329 The same year during an interview with Michael Kimmelman for The New York Times he said Art was seriously the only thing Id ever wanted to own. 332 Subsequently in a 1999 interview for the BBC he said The only thing I buy obsessively and addictively is art . 333 His art collection which included works by Damien Hirst Derek Boshier Frank Auerbach Henry Moore and Jean-Michel Basquiat among others was valued at over 10 million in mid-2016. 331 334 After his death his family decided to sell most of the collection because they didnt have the space to store it. 331 On 10 and 11 November three auctions were held at Sothebys in London. 335 The items on sale represented about 65 per cent of the collection. 336 Exhibition of the works in the auction attracted 51 470 visitors the auction itself was attended by 1 750 bidders with over 1 000 more bidding online. The auctions has overall sale total 32.9 million app. 41.5 million while the highest-selling item Basquiats graffiti-inspired painting Air Power sold for 7.09 million. 335 337 Writings Outside of music Bowie dabbled in several forms of writings during his life. In the late 1990s Bowie was commissioned for writings of various media including an essay on Jean-Michel Basquiat for the 2001 anthology book Writers on Artists and forewords to Jo Levins 2001 publication GQ Cool Mick Rocks 2001 photography portfolio Blood and Glitter his wife Imans 2001 book I Am Iman Q magazines 2002 special The 100 Greatest Rock n Roll Photographs and Jonathan Barnbrooks artwork portfolio Barnbrook Bible: The Graphic Design of Jonathan Barnbrook . 329 He also heavily contributed to the 2002 Genesis Publications memoir of the Ziggy Stardust years Moonage Daydream which was rereleased in 2022. 338 Bowie also wrote liner notes for several albums including Too Many Fish in the Sea by Robin Clark the wife of his guitarist Carlos Alomar Stevie Ray Vaughans posthumous Live at Montreux 1982 1985 2002 the Spinners compilation The Chrome Collection 2003 the tenth anniversary reissue of Placebos debut album 2006 and Neu! s Vinyl Box 2010. 329 Bowie also wrote an appreciation piece in Rolling Stone for Nine Inch Nails in 2005 and an essay for the booklet accompanying Iggy Pops A Million in Prizes: The Anthology the same year. 329 Bowie Bonds Main article: Celebrity bond Bowie Bonds the first modern example of celebrity bonds were asset-backed securities of current and future revenues of the 25 albums that Bowie recorded before 1990. 339 Issued in 1997 the bonds were bought for US55 million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America . 340 341 Royalties from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds interest payments. 342 By forfeiting 10 years worth of royalties Bowie received a payment of US55 million up front. Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by Defries. 343 The bonds liquidated in 2007 and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie. 344 Websites Bowie launched two personal websites during his lifetime. The first an Internet service provider titled BowieNet was developed in conjunction with Robert Goodale and Ron Roy and launched in September 1998. 345 346 Subscribers to the dial-up service were offered exclusive content as well as a BowieNet email address and Internet access. The service was closed by 2006. 345 The second www.bowieart.com allowed fans to view and purchase selected paintings prints and sculptures from his private collection. The service which ran from 2000 to 2008 also offered a showcase for young art students in Bowies words to show and sell their work without having to go through a dealer. Therefore they really make the money they deserve for their paintings. 329 Philanthropy Bowie was involved in philanthropic and charitable efforts for HIVAIDS research in Africa as well as other humanitarian projects helping disadvantaged children and developing nations ending poverty and hunger promoting human rights and providing education and health care to children affected by war. 347 A portion of the proceeds from the Pay-per-view showing of Bowies 50th birthday concert in 1997 was donated to Save the Children . 348 Musicianship Bowies Vox Mark VI guitar in the Hard Rock Cafe Warsaw Poland From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and roll singers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley whose vocal style he frequently adopted and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release David Bowie to the disgust of Newley himself who destroyed the copy he received from Bowies publisher. 34 349 Bowies fascination with music hall continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal soul psychedelic folk and pop. 350 The musicologist James E. Perone observes Bowies use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody exemplified in Space Oddity and later in Heroes to dramatic effect; the author writes that in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness . 351 The voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowies vocal vibrato technique as particularly deliberate and distinctive . 352 The authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz call him a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability able to pitch his singing to particular effect. 353 Here too as in his stagecraft and songwriting Bowies roleplaying is evident: the historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowies lyrics arrest our ear without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section. 354 In addition to the guitar Bowie also played a variety of keyboards including piano Mellotron Chamberlin and synthesisers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; stylophone ; viola; cello; koto on the Heroes track Moss Garden ; thumb piano ; drums on the Heathen track Cactus and various percussion instruments. 355 356 357 358 Personal life Family Bowie and wife Iman 2009 Bowie married his first wife Mary Angela Barnett on 19 March 1970 at Bromley Register Office in Bromley London. 359 Their son Duncan born on 30 May 1971 was at first known as Zowie. 360 Angie later described her and Davids union as a marriage of convenience. We got married so that I could get a permit to work. I didnt think it would last and David said before we got married Im not really in love with you and I thought thats probably a good thing she said. Bowie said about Angie that living with her is like living with a blow torch . 359 The couple divorced on 8 February 1980; 361 David received custody of Duncan. After the gag order that was part of their divorce agreement ended Angie wrote a memoir of their turbulent marriage titled Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side with David Bowie . 362 David met Somali-American model Iman in Los Angeles following the SoundVision Tour in October 1990. 178 They married in a private ceremony in Lausanne on 24 April 1992. The wedding was solemnised on 6 June in Florence . 363 The couples marriage influenced the content of Black Tie White Noise particularly on tracks such as The Wedding The Wedding Song and Miracle Goodnight . 364 They had one daughter Alexandria Lexi Zahra Jones born on 15 August 2000. 206 365 The couple resided primarily in New York City and London as well as owning an apartment in Sydneys Elizabeth Bay 366 367 and Britannia Bay House on the island of Mustique . 368 Following Bowies death Iman expressed gratitude that the two were able to maintain separate identities during their marriage. 369 Other relationships Left to right: Dana Gillespie Tony Defries and David Bowie at Andy Warhols Pork at Londons Roundhouse in 1971 Bowie began a personal and professional relationship with the singer Dana Gillespie in 1964 when he was 17 and she was 14. 370 371 Their relationship lasted a decade; Bowie wrote the song Andy Warhol for her Gillespie sang backing vocals on Ziggy Stardust and Bowie and Mick Ronson produced her 1973 album Werent Born a Man . Bowie ended contact with Gillespie following his split from Angie. Gillespie looked back on her time with Bowie fondly. 372 Bowie met the dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre . 373 He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image really blossomed : 373 He lived on his emotions he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus. 374 In January 1968 Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play The Pistol Shot and used Bowie with a dancer Hermione Farthingale; 375 the pair began dating and moved into a London flat together. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film Song of Norway ; 376 this affected him and several songs such as Letter to Hermione and An Occasional Dream reference her; 377 and for the video accompanying Where Are We Now? he wore a T-shirt with the words ms Song of Norway . 378 Bowie blamed himself for their break-up saying in 2002 that he was totally unfaithful and couldnt for the life of me keep it zipped . 377 Farthingale who spoke of deep affection for him in an interview with Pegg said they last saw each other in 1970. 377 David and Angie had an open marriage and dated other people during it: David had relationships with the models Cyrinda Foxe Lulu 379 Bebe Buell and the Young Americans backing singer Ava Cherry ; 380 381 382 Angie had encounters with the Stooges members Ron Asheton and James Williamson and the Ziggy Stardust Tour bodyguard Anton Jones. 383 In 1983 Bowie briefly dated the New Zealand model Geeling Ng who starred in the video for China Girl . 384 While filming The Hunger the same year Bowie had a sexual relationship with his co-star Susan Sarandon who stated in 2014 Hes worth idolising. Hes extraordinary. 385 Between 1987 and 1990 Bowie dated the Glass Spider Tour dancer Melissa Hurley. The two began their relationship at the end of the tour when she was 22 years old. Bowies Tin Machine collaborator Kevin Armstrong remembered her as a genuinely kind sweet person . 386 She inspired the song Amazing on Tin Machine 1989. 387 They announced their engagement in May 1989 but never married; Bowie broke the relationship off during the latter half of the SoundVision Tour primarily due to the age differencehe was 43 at the time. He later spoke of Hurley as such a wonderful lovely vibrant girl . 162 386 Coco Schwab Corinne Coco Schwab was Bowies personal assistant for 43 years from 1973 until his death in 2016. Originally a receptionist at the London office of MainMan Schwab assisted in extracting Bowie from MainMans financial grip after which he invited her to be his personal assistant. 388 389 Bowie referred to Schwab as his best friend and credited her for saving his life in the 1970s by helping him quit his drug addiction; 389 he dedicated the 1987 song Never Let Me Down to her. 390 Schwab maintained close guard of him and did not get along with Angie who later blamed Schwab for the downfall of her and Bowies marriage. 389 Bowie left 2 million to Schwab in his will. Upon his death friends of Bowie including Tony Zanetta and Robin Clark offered tributes to Schwab. 389 Sexuality Bowies sexuality has been the subject of debate. 391 392 While married to Angie 393 he famously declared himself gay in a 1972 interview with Melody Maker journalist Michael Watts 394 which generated publicity in both America and Britain; 395 Bowie was adopted as a gay icon in both countries. 396 According to Buckley If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality. 397 He affirmed his stance in a 1976 interview with Playboy stating: Its trueI am a bisexual . But I cant deny that Ive used that fact very well. I suppose its the best thing that ever happened to me. 398 His claim of bisexuality has been supported by Angie. 399 In 1983 Bowie told Rolling Stone writer Kurt Loder that his public declaration of bisexuality was the biggest mistake I ever made and I was always a closet heterosexual . 400 On other occasions he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings. b 402 Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause he said I dont think it was a mistake in Europe but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people. Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality and in puritanical America I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do. 403 Buckley wrote that Bowie mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock . 404 According to Mary Finnigana brief girlfriend of Bowies in 1969 405 David and Angie created their bisexual fantasy . 406 Sandford wrote that David made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while fucking the same bloke ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter . 406 The BBCs Mark Easton stated in 2016 that Britain was far more tolerant of difference and that gay rights and gender equality would not have enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowies androgynous challenge all those years ago . 407 Spirituality and religion Beginning in 1967 from the influence of his half-brother 16 Bowie became interested in Buddhism and with commercial success eluding him 408 he considered becoming a Buddhist monk. 409 Biographer Marc Spitz states that the religion reminded the young artist that other goals in life existed outside fame and material gain and one can learn about themselves through meditation and chanting. 408 After a few months study at Tibet House in London he was told by his Lama Chime Rinpoche You dont want to be Buddhist. ... You should follow music. 410 411 By 1975 Bowie admitted I felt totally absolutely alone. And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God. 412 In his will Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali in accordance with the Buddhist rituals . 213 After Bowie married Iman in a private ceremony in 1992 he said they knew that their real marriage sanctified by God had to happen in a church in Florence . 413 Earlier that year he knelt on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lords Prayer before a television audience. 183 c In 1993 Bowie said he had an undying belief in the unquestionable existence of God. 412 In a separate 1993 interview while describing the genesis of the music for his album Black Tie White Noise he said it was important for me to find something musically that also had no sort of representation of institutionalized and organized religion of which Im not a believer I must make that clear. 414 Interviewed in 2005 Bowie said whether God exists is not a question that can be answered. ... Im not quite an atheist and it worries me. Theres that little bit that holds on: Well Im almost an atheist. Give me a couple of months. ... Ive nearly got it right. 415 He had a tattoo of the Serenity Prayer in Japanese on his left calf. 416 Bowie stated that questioning his spiritual life was always ... germane to his songwriting. 415 The song Station to Station is very much concerned with the Stations of the Cross ; the song also specifically references Kabbalah . Bowie called the album extremely dark ... the nearest album to a magick treatise that Ive written . d 418 Earthling showed the abiding need in me to vacillate between atheism or a kind of gnosticism ... What I need is to find a balance spiritually with the way I live and my demise. 418 Hours boasted overtly Christian themes with its artwork inspired by the Pieta . 419 Blackstar s Lazarus began with the words Look up here Im in Heaven while the rest of the album deals with other matters of mysticism and mortality. 420 Political views As a seventeen-year-old still known as Davy Jones he was a cofounder and spokesman for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Long-Haired Men in response to members of the Manish Boys being asked to cut their hair before a BBC television appearance. 421 He and his bandmates were interviewed on the networks 12 November 1964 instalment of Tonight to champion their cause. 422 He stated on the programme I think we all like long hair and we dont see why other people should persecute us because of it. 423 In 1976 speaking as the Thin White Duke persona and at least partially tongue-in-cheek he made statements that expressed support for fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy NME and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: Britain is ready for a fascist leader ... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership. He was also quoted as saying: Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars and Youve got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up. 424 425 These comments along with Eric Clapton s comments in support of Enoch Powell at that time have been named as an inspiration for the formation of the Rock Against Racism movement. 426 Bowie retracted his comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977 blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems saying: I was out of my mind totally completely crazed. 427 In the same interview Bowie described himself as apolitical stating the more I travel and the less sure I am about exactly which political philosophies are commendable. The more government systems I see the less enticed I am to give my allegiance to any set of people so it would be disastrous for me to adopt a definitive point of view or to adopt a party of people and say these are my people. 428 In the 1980s and 1990s Bowies public statements shifted sharply towards anti-racism and anti-fascism . In an interview with MTV anchor Mark Goodman in 1983 Bowie criticised the channel for not providing enough coverage of Black musicians becoming visibly uncomfortable when Goodman suggested that the networks fear of backlash from the American Midwest was one reason for such a lack of coverage. 429 430 The music videos for China Girl and Lets Dance were described by Bowie as a very simple very direct statement against racism. 431 The album Tin Machine took a more direct stance against fascism and neo-Nazism and was criticised for being too preachy. 432 In 1993 he released the single Black Tie White Noise which dealt with the 1992 Los Angeles riots . 433 In 2007 Bowie donated 10 000 to the defence fund for the Jena Six saying there is clearly a separate and unequal judicial process going on in the town of Jena . 434 When Bowie won the British Male Solo Artist award at the 2014 Brit Awards he referenced the forthcoming Scottish independence referendum by saying Scotland stay with us. 435 This garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media. 436 437 Death Main article: Death of David Bowie A woman places flowers outside Bowies apartment in New York on Lafayette Street the day after his death was announced. Bowie died of liver cancer in his New York City apartment on 10 January 2016. 438 He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier but he had not made his condition public. 247 The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove who had worked with Bowie on his off-Broadway musical Lazarus explained that while Bowie was unable to attend its rehearsals due to the progression of the disease he had otherwise continued to work during his illness. 439 Tony Visconti wrote: He always did what he wanted to do. And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His death was no different from his life a work of art. He made Blackstar for us his parting gift. I knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasnt however prepared for it. He was an extraordinary man full of love and life. He will always be with us. For now it is appropriate to cry. 440 441 Following Bowies death fans gathered at impromptu street shrines. 442 At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton South London which shows him in his Aladdin Sane character fans laid flowers and sang his songs. 443 Other memorial sites included Berlin Los Angeles and outside his apartment in New York. 444 After news of his death sales of his albums and singles soared. 445 Bowie had insisted that he did not want a funeral and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January. 446 As he wished in his will his ashes were scattered in a Buddhist ceremony in Bali Indonesia . 447 Legacy and influence Bowies star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Berlin memorial plaque Hauptstrae 155 in Schoneberg Germany Bowie is generally regarded as one of the most influential musicians of all time. 448 449 450 According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian by 1980 he was the most important and influential artist since the Beatles . 451 His influence was wide-reaching due to constant reinvention 452 paving the way for performers such as Madonna and Lady Gaga 449 and leading him to be dubbed the chameleon of rock . 453 454 The biographer Thomas Forget said in 2002: Because he succeeded in so many different styles of music it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie. 455 Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had one of the supreme careers in popular music art and culture of the 20th century and he was too inventive too mercurial too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with . 456 Bowies songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s strongly influencing its immediate forms and subsequent development. 457 Perone credited Bowie with having brought sophistication to rock music and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. 457 458 459 The BBCs arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso writing that he was an innovative visionary restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions . 460 Schinder and Schwartz credited Bowie and Marc Bolan as the founders of the glam rock genre. 457 He also inspired the innovators of the punk rock movement 461 and explored grunge and alternative rock styles with the band Tin Machine before those styles became popular. 462 169 In The New York Times Jon Pareles said Bowie transcended music art and fashion and introduced his audiences to Philadelphia funk Japanese fashion German electronica and drum-and-bass dance music. 449 Billboard s Joe Lynch argued Bowie influenced more musical genres than any other rock star from glam rock folk rock and hard rock to electronic industrial rock and synth-pop to even hip hop and indie rock . 450 Broadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries arguing that Bowie was an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things . Peel said he liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didnt progress. Before Bowie came along people didnt want too much change ; then Bowie subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star . 463 Buckley called Bowie both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced ... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. ... His influence has been unique in popular culturehe has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure. 464 The BBCs Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for the creative powerhouse that Britain has become by challenging future generations to aim high to be ambitious and provocative to take risks concluding that he had changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself . 407 In 2006 Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBCs Culture Show . 465 Annie Zaleski wrote Every band or solo artist whos decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie . 466 Numerous figures from the music industry whose careers Bowie had influenced paid tribute to him following his death; panegyrics on Twitter tweets about him peaked at 20 000 a minute an hour after the announcement of his death 467 also came from outside the entertainment industry and pop culture such as those from the Vatican namely Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi who quoted Space Oddity and the German Federal Foreign Office which thanked Bowie for his part in the fall of the Berlin Wall and referenced Heroes . 468 469 On 7 January 2017 the BBC broadcast the 90-minute documentary David Bowie: The Last Five Years . 470 A day later which would have been Bowies 70th birthday a charity concert in his birthplace of Brixton was hosted by close friend and actor Gary Oldman . 471 A David Bowie walking tour through Brixton was also launched and other events marking his birthday weekend included concerts in New York Los Angeles Sydney and Tokyo. 472 David Bowie Is Main article: David Bowie Is An exhibition of Bowie artefacts called David Bowie Is was organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and shown there in 2013. 473 The London exhibit was visited by over 300 000 people making it one of the most successful exhibitions ever staged at the museum. 474 Later that year the exhibition began a world tour which started in Toronto and included stops lasting a few months each throughout Europe Asia and North America before the exhibit ended in 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum . 475 The exhibition hosted around 2 000 000 visitors over its run. 476 Stardust biopic Main article: Stardust 2020 film The biopic Stardust was announced on 31 January 2019 with musician and actor Johnny Flynn as Bowie Jena Malone as his wife Angie and Marc Maron as his publicist. 477 Written by Christopher Bell and directed by Gabriel Range the film follows Bowie on his first trip to the United States in 1971. Bowies son Duncan Jones spoke out against the film saying he was not consulted and that the film would not have permission to use Bowies music. 478 The film was set to premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic . 479 Critics were generally unfavourable in their reviews. 480 Moonage Daydream Main article: Moonage Daydream film A film based on Bowies musical journey throughout his career was announced on 23 May 2022. Titled Moonage Daydream after the song Moonage Daydream the film is written and directed by Brett Morgen and features never-before-seen footage performances and music framed by Bowies own narration.

Performing alone his set was warmly received. 208 In 1993 Bowie recalled having read City of Night in the 1960s and it connected with his loneliness. And that led me a merry dance in the early Seventies when gay clubs really became my lifestyle and all my friends were gay . 401 Asked why he knelt and prayed Bowie said he had a friend who was dying of AIDS. He was just dropping into a coma that day. And just before I went on stage something just told me to say the Lords Prayer. The great irony is that he died two days after the show . 412 He later said he was influenced by his cocaine addiction and the psychological terror from making The Man Who Fell To Earth marking the first time Id really seriously thought about Christ and God ... I very nearly got suckered into that narrow view of finding the Cross as the salvation of mankind . 417 Additional sources place this figure somewhere between 100 million and 150 million. 496 David Bowie 1969 was the original name for the album in the UK while in the US it was released a few months later with the subtitle Man of Words Man of Music 1969 colloquially used as an unofficial retitle to differentiate the release. 50 Following the success of Ziggy Stardust the album was rereleased worldwide as Space Oddity after Bowies well known song of the same name that opened the album. The David Bowie title was reinstated for a 2009 worldwide reissue and Parlophone s 2015 remaster 50 before the albums 2019 mix reverted back to the Space Oddity title. 531 References Citations How to say: Bowie .
