When I was like three years old I may have been even younger my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young and short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano ... I was really really good at piano so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano and I might not have been a natural dancer but I am a natural musician.
