Early life and education Angelina Jolie Voight was born on June 4 1975 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles California to actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand . 5 4 6 She is the sister of actor James Haven and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor 7 and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight . 8 Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell . 9 On her fathers side Jolie is of German and Slovak descent. 10 Jolie has claimed to have distant Indigenous Iroquois ancestry through her French-Canadian mother. However her father says Jolie is not seriously Iroquois saying it is something he and Bertrand made up to make Bertrand seem more exotic . 11 Jolies father actor Jon Voight attending the 60th Academy Awards in 1988 Following her parents separation in 1976 she and her brother lived with their mother who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. 12 Jolies mother raised her as a Catholic but did not require her to go to church. 13 As a child she often watched films with her mother and it was this rather than her fathers successful career that inspired her interest in acting 14 though she had a bit part in Voights Lookin to Get Out 1982 at age seven. 15 When Jolie was six years old Bertrand and her live-in partner filmmaker Bill Day moved the family to Palisades New York ; 16 they returned to Los Angeles five years later. 12 Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School where she felt isolated among the children of some of the areas affluent families because her mother had a more modest income. She was teased by other students who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces. 14 Her early attempts at modeling at her mothers insistence proved unsuccessful. 17 18 She transferred to Moreno High School an alternative school where she became a punk outsider 17 wearing all-black clothing going out moshing and engaging in knife play with her live-in boyfriend. 14 She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director 15 taking at-home courses on embalming. 19 At age 16 after the relationship had ended Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment before returning to theater studies 12 17 though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation I am still at heartand always will bejust a punk kid with tattoos. 20 As a teenager Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people and as a result she self-harmed 21 later commenting For some reason the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain maybe feeling alive feeling some kind of release it was somehow therapeutic to me. 22 She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder 19 and began using drugs; by age 20 she had used just about every drug possible particularly heroin . 23 Jolie had episodes of depression and planned to commit suicide twiceat age 19 and again at 22 when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her. 15 When she was 24 she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center s psychiatric ward. 15 Two years later after adopting her first child Jolie found stability later stating I knew once I committed to Maddox I would never be self-destructive again. 24 Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father which started when Voight left the family when she was less than a year old. 25 She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press. 26 They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider 2001 but their relationship again deteriorated. 12 Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname Voight in favor of her middle name which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12 2002. 27 Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood in which he claimed Jolie had serious mental problems. 28 At that point her mother and brother also broke off contact with him. 29 They did not speak for six and a half years 30 later rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrands death from ovarian cancer on January 27 2007 29 31 before going public with their reconciliation three years later. 29 Career Early work 19911997 Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16 but initially found it difficult to pass auditions often being told that her demeanor was too dark. 15 She appeared in five of her brothers student films made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television as well as in several music videos such as those for Lenny Kravitz s Stand by My Woman 1991 Antonello Venditti s Alta Marea 1991 The Lemonheads s Its About Time 1993 and Meat Loaf s Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through 1993. In 1993 she appeared on the cover of the Widespread Panic album Everyday . 32 Jolie then learned from her father by noticing his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship was less strained during this time with Jolie realizing that they were both drama queens . 14 Jolie started her professional film career in 1993 when she played her first leading role in the direct-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2 as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year. 15 Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence 1995 she starred in her first major studio film Hackers 1995. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote that Jolies character stands out ... because she scowls even more sourly than her co-stars and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top. 33 Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office but developed a cult following after its video release. 34 The role in Hackers is considered Jolies breakthrough . 35 36 37 After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is 1996 Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon 1996. In Foxfire 1996 she played Legs a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character but Jolie Jon Voights knockout daughter has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy Legs is the subject and the catalyst. 38 In 1997 Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert wrote that Jolie finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be a mobsters girlfriend and maybe she is. 39 Her next work as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women 1997 was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer Robert Strauss dismissed her as horrid a fourth-rate Scarlett OHara who relies on gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips. 40 Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones s Anybody Seen My Baby? as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City. 41 Rise to prominence 19982000 Jolies career prospects improved after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT s George Wallace 1997 a film about segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace played by Gary Sinise . Jolie portrayed Wallaces second wife Cornelia Wallace a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film. 42 George Wallace was well received by critics and Jolie received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her performance. 43 Jolie portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO s Gia 1998. The television film chronicles the destruction of Carangis life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia and its easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayalfilling the part with nerve charm and desperationand her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed. 44 For the second consecutive year Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and received an Emmy Award nomination. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award . 45 In accordance with Lee Strasberg s method acting Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films. While shooting Gia she told her husband Jonny Lee Miller that she would not be able to phone him: Id tell him: Im alone; Im dying; Im gay; Im not going to see you for weeks. 46 After Gia wrapped she briefly gave up acting because she felt that she had nothing else to give. 15 She separated from Miller and moved to New York where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting. 12 Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia Jolie resumed her career. 15 Following the previously filmed gangster film Hells Kitchen 1998 Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart 1998 part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery Gillian Anderson and Ryan Phillippe . The film received predominantly positive reviews and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote Jolie working through an overwritten part is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what shes willing to gamble. 47 She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review . 48 In 1999 Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin alongside John Cusack Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett . The film met with mixed reception from critics and Jolies characterThorntons seductive wifewas particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post Desson Howe dismissed her as a completely ludicrous writers creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home. 49 Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector 1999 playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washingtons quadriplegic detective track down a serial killer . The film grossed 151.5 million worldwide 50 but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded Jolie while always delicious to look at is simply and woefully miscast. 51 Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim. Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolies performance in Girl Interrupted 1999 52 Jolie next took the supporting role of Lisa a sociopathic patient in a psychiatric hospital in Girl Interrupted 1999 an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen s 1993 memoir . For Variety Emanuel Levy deemed her excellent as the flamboyant irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susannas rehabilitation. 53 Jolie won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress Motion Picture the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film. In 2000 Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster Gone in 60 Seconds which became her highest-grossing film to that point earning 237.2 million internationally. 50 She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage ; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that all she does in this movie is stand around cooling down modeling those fleshy pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth. 54 Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl Interrupted . Worldwide recognition 20012004 Although widely praised for her acting and performances Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience but 2001s Lara Croft: Tomb Raider made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider video games the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft . Although the film generated mostly negative reviews Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday s John Anderson commented Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth. 55 The film was an international hit earning 274.7 million worldwide 50 and launched her global reputation as a female action star. Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin 2001 the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolies decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with soft-core nonsense. 56 The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It 2002 though equally unsuccessful marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon magazine s Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional womens role noting that her performance doesnt get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing Satisfaction . 57 Despite her lack of box office success Jolie remained in demand as an actress; 20 in 2002 she established herself among Hollywoods highest-paid actresses earning 1015 million per film for the next five years. 58 Jolie at the German premiere of Alexander in 2004 Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life 2003 which was not as lucrative as the original earning 156.5 million at the international box office. 50 She also starred in the music video for Korn s Did My Time which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders 2003 in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen . Though unsuccessful with audiences the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes. 59 Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolies ability to bring electricity and believability to roles but wrote that the limbo of a hybrid character a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested blood-and-guts world completely defeats her. 60 In 2004 Jolie appeared in four films. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour. 61 Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen and voiced her first family film the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale . Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone s Alexander about Alexander the Great was met with mixed reception particularly concerning her Slavic accent. 57 Commercially the film failed in North America which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexanders bisexuality 62 but it succeeded internationally grossing 167.3 million. 50 Established actress 20052010 In 2005 Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. Mrs. Smith in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted While the story feels haphazard the movie gets by on gregarious charm galloping energy and the stars thermonuclear screen chemistry. 63 With box office takings of 478.2 million worldwide Mr. Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolies highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade. 50 64 Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro s The Good Shepherd 2006 Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart 2007. Based on Pearls 2003 memoir the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan. Although the multiracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role 65 the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface . 66 The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as well-measured and moving played with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent. 67 She received nominations for the Golden Globe Award and the Screen Actors Guild Award . Jolie also played Grendels mother in the epic Beowulf 2007 created through motion capture . The film was critically and commercially well-received earning 196.4 million worldwide. 50 In 2008 Jolie was the highest-paid actress earning 1520 million per film. 68 69 While other actresses had taken salary cuts during the time Jolies perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as 20 million plus a percentage. 70 She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted 2008 which proved an international success earning 341.4 million worldwide. 50 The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was perfectly cast as a super-scary seemingly amoral assassin adding that she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats. 71 Jolie as Christine Collins on the set of Changeling in 2007 Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood s drama Changeling 2008. 72 Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril. 73 She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award a Screen Actors Guild Award the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Academy Award for Best Actress . 74 75 76 77 Jolie also voiced Tigress in the DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda film series. 78 After her mothers death in 2007 Jolie appeared in fewer films later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mothers acting ambitions. 79 Her first film in two years was the 2010 thriller Salt in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent . Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of 293.5 million Salt became an international success. 50 The film received generally positive reviews with Jolies performance in particular earning praise. 80 Empire critic William Thomas remarked When it comes to selling incredible crazy death-defying antics Jolie has few peers in the action business. 81 Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist 2010. The film was a critical failure. 82 Roger Ebert defended Jolies performance stating that she does her darndest and plays her femme fatale with flat-out drop-dead sexuality. 83 Despite commercially underperforming in the US the film succeeded at the international box office 84 cementing Jolies appeal to international audiences. 85 She received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical nomination for her performance which prompted speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony. 74 86 Expansion to directing 20112017 Jolie at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival After directing the documentary A Place in Time 2007 which was distributed through the National Education Association 87 Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey 2011 a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner set during the 199295 Bosnian War . She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador . 88 To ensure authenticity she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia including stars Goran Kostic and Zana Marjanovic and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay. 89 Upon release the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch whats onscreen. 90 The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war. 91 After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen Jolie starred in Maleficent 2014 a live-action re-imagining of Disney s 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty . Critical reception was mixed but Jolies performance in the titular role was singled out for praise; 92 The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the heart and soul of the film adding that she doesnt chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent she infuses it wielding a magnetic and effortless power. 93 In its opening weekend Maleficent earned nearly 70 million at the North American box office and over 100 million in other markets marking Jolies appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films genres usually dominated by male actors. 94 The film went on to gross 757.8 million worldwide becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolies highest-grossing film ever. 50 95 Jolie next completed her second directorial venture Unbroken 2014 a film about Louis Zamperini 19172014 a former Olympic track star and World War II soldier who survived a plane crash and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner. 96 Based on Laura Hillenbrand s book Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival Resilience and Redemption the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack OConnell . 97 After a positive early reception Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender 97 98 but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition 99 though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute . 100 101 Variety magazine s Justin Chang noted the films impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint but deemed it an extraordinary story told in dutiful unexceptional terms. 99 102 Financially Unbroken was successful at the box office worldwide. 103 Jolie promoting Eternals at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con Jolies next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea 2015 in which she starred opposite her husband Brad Pitt marking their first collaboration since 2005s Mr. Mrs. Smith . Based on her screenplay the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie who drew inspiration from her own mothers life. Critics however dismissed it as a vanity project as part of an overall poor reception. 104 105 Writing for The Washington Post Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion stating By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness sprinkled with stilted sentiments. 106 Despite starring two of Hollywoods leading actors the film received only a limited release. 104 As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father 2017 a drama set during Cambodias Khmer Rouge era again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung whose memoirs about the regimes child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience the film was produced directly for Netflix which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script. 107 Labeling Jolie as a skilled and sensitive filmmaker Rafer Guzman of Newsday commended her for convincingly depicting the illogical hell of the Khmer Rouge era . 108 It received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language . 109 110 Varying critical receptions 2019present Jolie reprised the role of Maleficent in the Disney fantasy sequel Maleficent: Mistress of Evil 2019 which received mixed reviews from critics but performed moderately well commercially with a global gross of 490 million. 111 112 113 The following year she appeared alongside David Oyelowo as grieving parents to the title characters of Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan in the fantasy film Come Away . 114 Jolie starred as a smokejumper in Taylor Sheridan s action thriller Those Who Wish Me Dead . The film was released in May 2021 garnering moderate reviews. 115 116 The Independent s Clarisse Loughrey wrote Jolies bare-knuckled performance ... easily outclasses the film that contains it . 117 Jolie next played Thena a warrior with post-traumatic stress disorder in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film Eternals . Released in November 2021 the film generated divergent responses from audiences and critics. 118 119 Reviewing the film for The Washington Post Ann Hornaday highlighted the touching naivete in Jolies portrayal. 120 Jolie was a producer on the musical The Outsiders after it transferred to Broadway in 2024 121 and won the Tony Award for Best Musical . 122 She starred in Pablo Larrain s biographical film about opera singer Maria Callas titled Maria which premiered at the 81st Venice International Film Festival . 123 Jolie also wrote produced and directed the 2024 war drama Without Blood based on the novel by Alessandro Baricco starring Salma Hayek and Demian Bichir . 124 Humanitarian work UNHCR ambassadorship We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I dont believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us. Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001 125 Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider 2001 in war-torn Cambodia an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world. 126 Upon her return home Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR for information on international trouble spots. 125 To learn more about the conditions in these areas she began visiting refugee camps around the world. 20 In February 2001 she went on her first field visit an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed. 125 In the following months Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan where she donated 1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal 127 128 the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual. 129 She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits. 125 Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27 2001. 130 Jolie and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at a UNHCR celebration of World Refugee Day in June 2005 Over the next decade she went on more than 40 field missions meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries. 131 In 2002 when asked what she hoped to accomplish she stated Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived not looked down upon. 127 To that end her 200102 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders . Jolie aimed to visit what she termed forgotten emergencies crises that media attention had shifted away from. 132 She became noted for traveling to war zones 133 such as Sudans Darfur region during the Darfur conflict 134 the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War 135 where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces 136 and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit. 133 To aid her travels she started to take flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world. Jolie acquired a pilot license in 2004; as of May 2014 she owns a Cirrus SR22 aircraft and a Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft. 137 138 On April 17 2012 after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner Antonio Guterres the first to take on such a position within the organization.

On March 10 2002 Jolie adopted her first child 224 seven-month-old Maddox Chivan 27 from an orphanage in Battambang Cambodia. 225 He was born on August 5 2001 226 in a local village. 19 After twice visiting Cambodia while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider 2001 and on a UNHCR field mission Jolie returned in November 2001 with her then-husband Billy Bob Thornton where they met and subsequently applied to adopt Maddox. 227 The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking. 227 Although Jolies adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful. 228 Once the process was finalized she took custody of Maddox in Namibia where she was filming Beyond Borders 2003. 227 Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together but she adopted Maddox alone 212 229 becoming a single parent following her separation from Thornton three months later. 212 230 Jolie adopted her second child six-month-old Zahara Marley from an orphanage in Addis Ababa Ethiopia on July 6 2005. 231 232 Zahara was born on January 8 2005 in Awasa . 233 234 Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan 235 based on official testimony from her grandmother 236 but Zaharas birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick and said she thought Zahara was very fortunate to have been adopted by Jolie. 233 Jolie was accompanied by her then-partner Brad Pitt when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara. 231 She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia 237 having first visited the country earlier that year. 238 After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children 239 she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt which was granted on January 19 2006. 234 Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after. 240 A pregnant Jolie attending the premiere of Changeling with director Clint Eastwood at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child. 216 On May 27 2006 she gave birth to Shiloh Nouvel in Swakopmund . 241 Shilohs middle name is homage to French architect Jean Nouvel . 242 During labor Jolie had fits of hysteric laughter due to the administration of morphine . 243 They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity rather than allowing paparazzi to take the photographs. 240 People and Hello! magazines purchased the North American and British rights to the images for 4.1 and 3.5 million respectively a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time 244 with all proceeds donated to UNICEF . 245 On March 15 2007 Jolie adopted her fourth child three-year-old Pax Thien from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam. 246 Pax was born on November 29 2003 in HCMC and was abandoned soon after birth. 247 After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006 Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent because Vietnams adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt. 246 After their return to the United States she petitioned the court to change Pax Thiens surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt which was approved on May 31. 248 Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21 2008. 249 At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice France reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade. 250 She gave birth to twins Knox Leon and Vivienne Marcheline on July 12 2008.

All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation. 252 Cancer prevention treatment On February 16 2013 at age 37 Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87 risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. 253 Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations : her mother had breast cancer and died of ovarian cancer while her grandmother died of ovarian cancer. 254 255 Her aunt who had the same BRCA1 defect died of breast cancer three months after Jolies operation. 256 Following the mastectomy which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under five percent Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts transplantations from a donor. 254 Two years later in March 2015 after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer she underwent a preventive salpingo-oophorectomy removal of an ovary and its fallopian tube as she had a fifty percent risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy the surgery brought on premature menopause . 255 I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they too will be able to get gene tested and that if they have a high risk they too will know that they have strong options. Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy 253 After completing each operation Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis surgeries and personal experiences and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children. 253 255 257 Jolie further wrote: On a personal note I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity. 253 Jolies announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing. 258 Her decision was met with praise from various public figures 259 while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women. 260 Dubbed The Angelina Effect by a Time cover story 261 Jolies influence led to a global and long-lasting increase in BRCA gene testing: 262 the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the United Kingdom parts of Canada and India 262 263 264 as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the United States. 265 266 267 Researchers in Canada and the United Kingdom found that despite the large increase the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same meaning Jolies message had reached those most at risk. 262 In her first op-ed Jolie had advocated for wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs 268 which were greatly reduced after a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics . 269 270 Reception Public image Jolie at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival As the daughter of actor Jon Voight Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. 26 Early in her own career she earned a reputation as a wild child which contributed to her success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. 271 Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives experiences with drugs and her sex life particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism . 271 272 In 2000 when asked about her outspokenness she stated: I say things that other people might go through. Thats what artists should dothrow things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand. 272 Another contributing factor to her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that emerged when Jolie upon winning her Oscar for Girl Interrupted kissed her brother on the lips and said Im so in love with my brother right now. 15 She dismissed the rumors saying It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus 273 and explained that as children of divorced parents she and James relied on one another for emotional support. 15 Jolies reputation started to change positively after she at age 26 became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees later commenting In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington and I fight for something important. 130 Owing to her extensive activism her Q Score a marketing industry measure of celebrities likabilitynearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006. 130 Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006 she was familiar to 81 of Americans compared to 31 in 2000. 130 She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media without employing a publicist or an agent. 274 Her Q Score remained above average even when in 2005 she was accused of ending Brad Pitts marriage to Jennifer Aniston 275 at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker mother sex symbol and humanitarian. 276 Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016. 277 278 Jolies general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets Jolie together with Pitt was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide. 279 Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008 and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain . Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton reportedly worth 10 million was a record for a single advertising campaign. 280 281 Jolie was among the Time 100 a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time in 2006 and 2008. 282 283 She was named the worlds most powerful celebrity in Forbes s Celebrity 100 issue in 2009 and though ranked lower overall was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013. 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywoods highest-paid actress in 2009 2011 and 2013 with estimated annual earnings of 27 million 30 million and 33 million respectively. 85 291 292 Appearance Jolie at the premiere of A Mighty Heart in 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolies public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal. 293 Many media outlets including Vogue People and Vanity Fair have cited her as the worlds most beautiful woman while others such as Esquire FHM and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women. 294 Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos eyes and in particular her full lips which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas chin or Bette Davis eyes. 295 Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit what nourishes me destroys me the Tennessee Williams quote A prayer for the wild at heart kept in cages four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection 296 297 a 12-inch tiger and geographical coordinates of where she first met her adopted children. 298 Over time she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos including Billy Bob the name of her second husband. 296 Professionally Jolies status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider 2001 and Beowulf 2007 overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal 299 300 with Empire stating that her pneumatic figure feline eyes and bee-stung lips have greatly contributed to her appeal to audiences. 301 Conversely Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolies dark and intense sexuality has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in thus rendering her unconvincing in many conventional womens roles 57 while Clint Eastwood who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling 2008 opined that having the most beautiful face on the planet sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences. 302 Jolies appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large.
