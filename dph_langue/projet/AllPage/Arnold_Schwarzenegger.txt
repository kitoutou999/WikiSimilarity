He served as the 38th governor of California from 2003 to 2011. 5 Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at age 15 and won the Mr. Universe title aged 20 and subsequently the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is tied with Phil Heath for the joint-second number of all-time Mr. Olympia wins behind Ronnie Coleman and Lee Haney who are joint-first with eight wins each. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time 6 7 and has written many books and articles about it. 8 The Arnold Sports Festival considered the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia is named after him. 9 He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron 1977. After retiring from bodybuilding he gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian 1982 10 a box-office success with a sequel in 1984. 11 After playing the title character in the science fiction film The Terminator 1984 he starred in Terminator 2: Judgment Day 1991 and three other sequels. His other successful action films included Commando 1985 The Running Man 1987 Predator 1987 Total Recall 1990 and True Lies 1994 in addition to comedy films such as Twins 1988 Kindergarten Cop 1990 and Jingle All the Way 1996. 12 He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions. 13 As a registered member of the Republican Party Schwarzenegger chaired the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during most of the George H. W. Bush administration . In 2003 he was elected Governor of California in a special recall election to replace Gray Davis the governor at the time. He received 48.6 percent of the vote 17 points ahead of the runner-up Cruz Bustamante of the Democratic Party . He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis term and was reelected in the 2006 gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9 percent to serve a full term. 14 In 2011 he reached his term limit as governor and returned to acting. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the Austrian Oak in his bodybuilding days Arnie or Schwarzy during his acting career 15 and the Governator a portmanteau of Governor and Terminator during his political career. He married Maria Shriver a niece of the former U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021. 16 Early life and education Schwarzeneggers birthplace Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Thal on July 30 1947 17 the second son of Gustav Schwarzenegger and his wife Aurelia nee Jadrny; 19221998. Gustav was the local chief of police and after the Anschluss in 1938 joined the Nazi Party and in 1939 the Sturmabteilung SA. In World War II Gustav served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland France and the Soviet Union including the siege of Leningrad rising to the title of Hauptfeldwebel . 18 19 He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad 20 and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria . According to Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum Gustav Schwarzenegger served in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role. 18 Gustavs background received wide press attention during the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Schwarzenegger was elected. 21 Gustav married Aurelia on October 20 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger his parents were very strict: Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents the rod was not spared. 22 He grew up in a Catholic family. 23 Gustav preferred his elder son Meinhard over Arnold. 24 His favoritism was strong and blatant which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child. 25 Schwarzenegger says that his earliest childhood memory is of climbing into his parents bed during a bad thunder-and-lightning storm and cuddling between his mother and father. 26 He has said however that his father had no patience for listening or understanding your problems . 23 He had a good relationship with his mother with whom he kept in touch until her death. 27 In an interview with Fortune in 2004 Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what would now be called child abuse at the hands of his father: My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children Ive seen were broken by their parents which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didnt want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform and whose will could not be broken. Therefore I became a rebel. Every time I got hit and every time someone said You cant do this I said This is not going to be for much longer because Im going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody. 19 At school Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average but stood out for his cheerful good-humored and exuberant character. 23 He struggled with reading and was later diagnosed as being dyslexic . 28 29 Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator. 25 His father Gustav was an athlete and wished for his sons to become champions in Bavarian curling . 30 Influenced by his father Schwarzenegger played several sports as a boy. 23 Schwarzenegger began weight training in 1960 when his football coach took his team to a local gym. 17 At age 14 he chose bodybuilding over football as a career. 11 31 He later said I actually started weight training when I was 15 but Id been participating in sports like soccer for years so I felt that although I was slim I was well-developed at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting . 22 However his official website biography claims that at 14 he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer studied psychology at 15 to learn more about the power of mind over body and at 17 officially started his competitive career. 32 During a speech in 2001 he said My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school. 33 Schwarzenegger in 1971 Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see films with bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park Steve Reeves and Johnny Weissmuller . 22 When Reeves died in 2000 Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: As a teenager I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didnt always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything Ive ever been fortunate enough to achieve. In 1961 Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. 17 He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends to train even when it was closed. It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldnt look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didnt do it. When asked about his first cinema experience as a boy he replied: I was very young but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels . The first real movie I saw that I distinctly remember was a John Wayne movie. 22 In Graz he was mentored by Alfred Gerstl who had Jewish ancestry and later became president of the Federal Council and befriended his son Karl. 34 35 Schwarzeneggers brother Meinhard died in a car crash on May 20 1971. 17 He was driving drunk and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp and they had a three-year-old son named Patrick . Schwarzenegger paid for Patricks education and helped him to move to the U.S. 25 Schwarzeneggers father Gustav died of a stroke on December 13 1972. 17 In Pumping Iron Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his fathers funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later he and the films producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzeneggers image colder to create controversy for the film. 36 However Barbara Baker his first serious girlfriend recalled that he informed her of his fathers death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother. 37 Over time he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his fathers funeral. 25 Schwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males. 17 32 During his army service he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest. 31 He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didnt carefully think through the consequences. He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz at Steirerhof Hotel where he placed second. He was voted best-built man of Europe which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to Americathe land of opportunity where I could become a star and get rich. 33 Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966 attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London. 32 He placed second in the Mr. Universe competition not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton . 32 Charles Wag Bennett one of the judges at the 1966 competition was impressed with Schwarzenegger and offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate London. Yortons leg definition had been judged superior and Schwarzenegger under a training program devised by Bennett concentrated on improving his. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary English. 38 39 Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When youre the age I was then youre always looking for approval for love for attention and also for guidance. At the time I wasnt really aware of that. But now looking back I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love. 40 Also in 1966 at Bennetts home Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park who became his friend and mentor. 40 41 The training paid off and in 1967 Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at age 20. 32 He would go on to win the title another three times. 31 He then returned to Munich where he attended business school and worked at Rolf Putzigers gym where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968 before returning to London in 1968 to win his next Mr. Universe title. 32 He frequently told Roger C. Field his English coach and friend in Munich at the time Im going to become the greatest actor! 42 Schwarzenegger who dreamed of moving to the US since age ten and saw bodybuilding as his avenue of opportunity 43 realized his dream by moving to the US in October 1968 at age 21 speaking little English. 31 17 There he trained at Golds Gym in Venice Los Angeles California under Joe Weider s supervision. From 1970 to 1974 one of Schwarzeneggers weight training partners was Ric Drasin a professional wrestler who designed the original Golds Gym logo in 1973. 44 Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler Superstar Billy Graham . In 1970 at age 23 Schwarzenegger captured his first Mr. Olympia title in New York and would go on to win the title seven times. 32 The immigration law firm Siskind Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an illegal immigrant at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his visa . 45 LA Weekly said in 2002 that Schwarzenegger was the most famous US immigrant who overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s . 43 In 1977 Schwarzeneggers autobiography and weight-training guide Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder was a huge success. 17 In 1977 he posed for the gay magazine After Dark . 46 47 After taking an assortment of courses at Santa Monica College in California including English classes as well as further upper division classes at the University of California Los Angeles as part of UCLAs extension program he accumulated enough credits to be within striking distance of graduation. In 1979 he enrolled in the University of WisconsinSuperior as a distance education student completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980 he formally graduated and earned his bachelors degree in business administration and marketing. He received his United States citizenship in 1983. 48 He received an honorary degree from Stockton University in 2023. 49 Bodybuilding career Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding 9 and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows. For many years he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle Fitness and Flex . Shortly after being elected governor he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate 250 000 a year to the Governors various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least 1 million a year was made public in 2005 many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governors office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California. 50 Consequently Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005. 50 American Media Inc. which owns Muscle Fitness and Flex announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines. 50 One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965. 17 He won Mr. Europe the following year at age 19. 17 32 He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins 4 NABBA England 1 IFBB USA and seven Mr. Olympia wins a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991. Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day. 51 Powerliftingweightlifting During Schwarzeneggers early years in bodybuilding he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests. Schwarzeneggers first professional competition was in 1963 52 and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965 as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968. 4 In 1967 Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds 254 kg 560 lb is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests. Personal records Clean and press 264 lb 120 kg 4 Snatch 243 lb 110 kg 4 Clean and jerk 298 lb 135 kg 4 Squat 545 lb 247 kg 4 Bench press 520 lb 240 kg 53 54 Deadlift 683 lb 310 kg 4 Schwarzenegger pictured with 1987 world champion American Karyn Marshall presenting awards at the USA Weightlifting Hall of Fame in 2011 in Columbus Ohio Mr. Olympia Schwarzeneggers goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world which meant becoming Mr. Olympia . 17 32 His first attempt was in 1969 when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva . However Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23 a record he still holds to this day. 32 He continued his winning streak in the 19711974 competitions. 32 He also toured different countries selling vitamins as in Helsinki Finland in 1972 when he lived at the YMCA Hotel Hospiz nowadays Hotel Arthur 55 on Vuorikatu and presented vitamin pills at the Stockmann shopping center . 56 57 In 1975 Schwarzenegger was once again in top form and won the title for the sixth consecutive time 32 beating Franco Columbu . After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding. 32 Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete and film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron . Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges . Although significantly taller and heavier Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger came out of retirement however to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia. 17 Schwarzenegger was training for his role in Conan and he got into such good shape because of the running horseback riding and sword training that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that while he was there Why not compete? Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory subject of the documentary The Comeback was highly controversial though as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass especially in his thighs and subpar conditioning should have precluded him from winning against a very competitive lineup that year. 9 58 Mike Mentzer in particular felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest. 59 58 Steroid use Schwarzenegger has acknowledged using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal writing in 1977 that steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up . 60 He has called the drugs tissue building . 61 In 1999 Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and later heart problems . Since the doctor never examined him personally Schwarzenegger collected a US10 000 libel judgment against him in a German court. 62 In 1999 Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with Globe a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilders future health. 63 List of competitions Arnold Schwarzenegger in bodybuilding competitions Year Competition 64 Location Result and notes 1965 Junior Mr. Europe Germany 1st 1966 Best Built Man of Europe Germany 1st 1966 Mr. Europe Germany 1st 1966 International Powerlifting Championship Germany 1st 1966 NABBA Mr. Universe amateur London 2nd to Chet Yorton 1967 NABBA Mr. Universe amateur London 1st 1968 NABBA Mr. Universe professional London 1st 1968 German Powerlifting Championship Germany 1st 1968 IFBB Mr. International Mexico 1st 1968 IFBB Mr. Universe Florida 2nd to Frank Zane 1969 IFBB Mr. Universe amateur New York 1st 1969 NABBA Mr. Universe professional London 1st 1969 Mr. Olympia New York 2nd to Sergio Oliva 1970 NABBA Mr. Universe professional London 1st defeated his idol Reg Park 1970 AAU Mr. World Columbus Ohio 1st defeated Sergio Oliva for the first time 1970 Mr. Olympia New York 1st 1971 Mr. Olympia Paris 1st 1972 Mr. Olympia Essen Germany 1st 1973 Mr. Olympia New York 1st 1974 Mr. Olympia New York 1st 1975 Mr. Olympia Pretoria South Africa 1st subject of the documentary Pumping Iron 1980 Mr. Olympia Sydney 1st subject of the documentary The Comeback Statistics Height: 6 ft 2 in 1.88 m Contest weight: 235 lb 107 kgthe lightest in 1980 Mr. Olympia: around 225 lb 102 kg the heaviest in 1974 Mr. Olympia: around 250 lb 110 kg 65 Off-season weight: 260 lb 118 kg Chest: 57 in 140 cm Waist: 33 in 84 cm Arms: 22 in 56 cm Thighs: 29.5 in 75 cm Calves: 20 in 51 cm 66 Acting career Main article: Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography 19701980: Early roles Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the title role in Hercules in New York 1970. Credited under the stage name Arnold Strong his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. 31 His second film appearance was as a mob hitman in The Long Goodbye 1973 which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry 1976 for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year Actor . Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: It was very difficult for me in the beginning I was told by agents and casting people that my body was too weird that I had a funny accent and that my name was too long. You name it and they told me I had to change it. Basically everywhere I turned I was told that I had no chance. 22 Schwarzenegger during filming for Pumping Iron in 1975 Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron 1977 11 31 elements of which were dramatized. In 1991 he purchased the rights to the film its outtakes and associated still photography. 67 In 1977 he made guest appearances in single episodes of the ABC sitcom The San Pedro Beach Bums and the ABC police procedural The Streets of San Francisco . Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of The Incredible Hulk but did not win the role because of his height. Later Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banners alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy The Villain . In 1980 he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress Jayne Mansfield as Mansfields husband Mickey Hargitay . 19822003: Action superstar Schwarzeneggers breakthrough film was the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982 which was a box-office hit. 11 This was followed by a sequel Conan the Destroyer in 1984 although it was not as successful as its predecessor. 68 In 1983 Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video Carnival in Rio . 69 In 1984 he made his first appearance as the eponymous character in James Cameron s science fiction action film The Terminator . 11 31 70 It has been called his acting careers signature role. 71 Following this Schwarzenegger made another sword and sorcery film Red Sonja in 1985. 68 During the 1980s audiences had an appetite for action films with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars. 31 During the Schwarzenegger-Stallone rivalry they attacked each other in the press and tried to surpass the other with more on-screen killings and larger weapons. 72 Schwarzeneggers roles reflected his sense of humor separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s such as Commando 1985 Raw Deal 1986 The Running Man 1987 Predator 1987 and Red Heat 1988. Footprints and handprints of Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of the Graumans Chinese Theatre with his catchphrase Ill be back written in Twins 1988 a comedy with Danny DeVito also proved successful. Total Recall 1990 netted Schwarzenegger 10 million equivalent to 23.3 million today and 15 of the films gross. A science fiction script the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale . Kindergarten Cop 1990 reunited him with director Ivan Reitman who directed him in Twins . Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt entitled The Switch 73 and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut . 74 He has not directed since. Schwarzeneggers commercial peak was his return as the title character in Terminator 2: Judgment Day 1991 which was the highest-grossing film of the year. Film critic Roger Ebert commented that Schwarzeneggers genius as a movie star is to find roles that build on rather than undermine his physical and vocal characteristics. 75 In 1993 the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the International Star of the Decade . 17 His next film project the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero was released opposite Jurassic Park and did not do well at the box office. His next film the comedy drama True Lies 1994 was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron. That same year the comedy Junior was released the last of Schwarzeneggers three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination this time for Best Actor Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . It was followed by the action thriller Eraser 1996 the Christmas comedy Jingle All The Way 1996 and the comic book-based Batman Robin 1997 in which he played the supervillain Mr. Freeze . This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of Batman Robin his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller End of Days 1999 later followed by the action films The 6th Day 2000 and Collateral Damage 2002 both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003 he made his third appearance as the title character in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines which went on to earn over 150 million domestically equivalent to 248 million today. 76 Arnold Schwarzeneggers star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002 Forum Stadtpark a local cultural association proposed plans to build a 25-meter-tall 80 ft Terminator statue in a park in central Graz .

Schwarzenegger with President Ronald Reagan in 1984 Schwarzenegger has been a registered Republican for many years. When he was an actor his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars who are generally considered to be a left-wing and Democratic -leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained that he was a Republican because he believed the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists . 106 I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams full of determination full of desire. The presidential campaign was in full swing. I remember watching the Nixon Humphrey presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism which I had just left. But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise getting the government off your back lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend I said What party is he? My friend said Hes a Republican. I said Then I am a Republican. And I have been a Republican ever since. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Capitol Hill in 1991 for an event related to the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports In 1985 Schwarzenegger appeared in Stop the Madness an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration . He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 presidential election accompanying thenVice President George H. W. Bush at a campaign rally. 107 Schwarzenegger famously introduced the first episode of the 1990 Milton Friedman hosted PBS series Free to Choose stating: I truly believe that the series has changed my life and when you have such a powerful experience as that I think you shouldnt keep it to yourself so I wanted to share it with you. Being free to choose for me means being free to make your own decisions free to live your own life pursue your own goals chase your own rainbow without the government breathing down on your neck or standing on your shoes. For me that meant coming here to America because I came from a socialistic country where the government controls the economy. Its a place where you can hear 18-year-old kids already talking about their pension. But me I wanted more. I wanted to be the best. Individualism like that is incompatible with socialism. So I felt I had to come to America. 108 109 Schwarzenegger goes on to tell of how he and his then wife Maria Shriver were in Palm Springs preparing to play a game of mixed doubles when Milton Friedmans famous show came on the television. Schwarzenegger recalls that while watching Friedmans Free to Choose Schwarzenegger ...recognized Friedman from the study of my own degree in economics but I didnt know I was watching Free to Choose... it knocked me out. Dr. Friedman expressed validated and explained everything I ever thought or experienced or observed about the way the economy works and I guess I was really ready to hear it. 109 Numerous critics state that Schwarzenegger strayed from much of Friedmans economic ways of thinking in later years especially upon being elected Governor of California from 2003 through 2011. 110 111 Schwarzeneggers first political appointment was as chairman of the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports on which he served from 1990 to 1993. 17 He was nominated by the then-President Bush who dubbed him Conan the Republican . He later served as chairman for the California Governors Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson . Between 1993 and 1994 Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities recording several television and radio public service announcements to donate blood. In an interview with Talk magazine in late 1999 Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside. The Hollywood Reporter claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California . Following his initial comments Schwarzenegger said Im in show business I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else? 112 Governor of California Main article: Governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger Governator redirects here. For the song see American Idiot . Schwarzeneggers official portrait as Governor of California 2003 Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6 2003 episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno . 31 Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news with media outlets dubbing him the Governator referring to The Terminator movies see above and The Running Man the name of another one of his films and calling the recall election Total Recall yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates and appeared in only one debate on September 24 2003. 113 President George W. Bush meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship. On October 7 2003 the recall election resulted in Governor Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4 of the Yes vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6 of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante fellow Republican Tom McClintock and others. His nearest rival Bustamante received 31 of the vote. In total Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862. Schwarzenegger is a moderate Republican . 114 He says he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal. 115 On the issue of abortion he describes himself as pro-choice but supports parental notification for minors and a ban on partial-birth abortion. 116 He has supported gay rights such as domestic partnerships and he performed a same-sex marriage as governor. 117 However Schwarzenegger vetoed bills that would have legalized same-sex marriage in California in 2005 and 2007. 118 119 He additionally vetoed two bills that would have implemented a single-payer health care system in California in 2006 120 121 and 2008 122 respectively. Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up political gridlock . Building on a catchphrase from the sketch Hans and Franz from Saturday Night Live which partly parodied his bodybuilding career Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians girlie men . 123 Arnold Schwarzenegger in June 2010 Schwarzeneggers early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing drivers licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005 in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He later commented that no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you . The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in Knox v. Service Employees International Union Local 1000 . 124 Schwarzenegger with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Cisco CEO John Chambers Schwarzenegger against the advice of fellow Republican strategists appointed a Democrat Susan Kennedy as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election. Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat Phil Angelides the California State Treasurer in the 2006 elections held on November 7 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0 of the vote compared with 38.9 for Angelides a margin of well over 1 million votes. 125 Around this time many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast in which Schwarzenegger said in part How wrong I was when I said everyone has an equal opportunity to make it in America ... the state of California does not provide equal education for all of our children San Francisco mayor and future governor of California Gavin Newsom said: Hes becoming a Democrat ... Hes running back not even to the center. I would say center-left. 126 Some speculated that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010 as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. Such rumors turned out to be false. 127 128 With Schwarzenegger and Senator Dianne Feinstein behind him President George W. Bush comments on wildfires and firefighting efforts in California October 2007. Wendy Leigh who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as the means to escape a depressing home. 24 Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100 of their potential I was always fascinated by people in control of other people. 24 Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics but he says I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes. 43 Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of John F. Kennedy and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger cannot run for U.S. president as he is not a natural-born citizen of the United States . Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian and United States citizen. 129 He has held Austrian citizenship since birth and U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European he was able to win the 2007 European Voice campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU. 130 Governor Schwarzenegger during his visit to Naval Medical Center in San Diego July 2010 Because of his personal wealth from his acting career Schwarzenegger did not accept his governors salary of 175 000 per year. 131 Schwarzeneggers endorsement in the Republican primaries of the 2008 presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30 2008 largely because of a poor showing in Florida and endorsed McCain. Later that night Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day he endorsed McCain joking Its Rudys fault! in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind. Schwarzeneggers endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCains campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy. 132 In its April 2010 report Progressive ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of 11 worst governors in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzeneggers term as governor. 133 134 Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66 a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot Schwarzenegger launched an intense campaign 135 against Proposition 66. 136 He stated that it would release 26 000 dangerous criminals and rapists . 137 Although he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings as high as 65 in May 2004 138 he left office with a near-record low 23 139 only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis his predecessor when he was recalled in October 2003. 140 Death of Luis Santos Main article: Death of Luis Santos In May 2010 Esteban Nunez pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the death of Luis Santos . Nunez is the son of Fabian Nunez then California Assembly Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger. 141 142 143 144 As a personal favor to a friend just hours before he left office and as one of his last official acts Schwarzenegger commuted Nunezs sentence by more than half to seven years. 143 145 146 He believed that Nunezs sentence was excessive in comparison with the same prison term imposed on Ryan Jett the man who fatally stabbed Santos. 147 Against protocol Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter. 146 The Santos family along with the San Diego district attorney sued to stop the commutation claiming that it violated Marsys Law . In September 2012 Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case there was an abuse of discretion... This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state. However Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor. 141 Subsequently as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that allows offenders victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days before any commutations. 148 Nunez was released from prison after serving less than six years. 149 Allegations of sexual misconduct Code Pink protesting against Schwarzenegger During his initial campaign for governor in 2003 allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger. 150 Within the last five days before the election news reports appeared in the Los Angeles Times recounting decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct from six individual women. 151 150 Schwarzenegger responded to the allegations in 2004 admitting that he has behaved badly sometimes and apologized but also stated that a lot of what you see in the stories is not true . 152 One of the women who came forward was British television personality Anna Richardson who settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger; his top aide Sean Walsh; and his publicist Sheryl Main. 153 A joint statement read: The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled. 153 154 In 2023 Schwarzenegger revisited the issue while promoting his new three-part biographical documentary on Netflix called Arnold . Schwarzenegger stated that he was totally wrong . 155 Marijuana use During this time a 1977 interview in adult magazine Oui gained attention in which Schwarzenegger discussed using substances such as marijuana . 156 Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in 1975 in the documentary film Pumping Iron 1977. In an interview with GQ magazine in October 2007 Schwarzenegger said Marijuana is not a drug. Its a leaf. My drug was pumping iron trust me. 157 His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke. 157 Citizenship Schwarzenegger in 2004 Schwarzenegger became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 17 1983. 158 Shortly before he gained his citizenship he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship . His request was granted and he retained his Austrian citizenship. 159 In 2005 Peter Pilz a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzeneggers Austrian citizenship under Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act which states: A citizen who is in the public service of a foreign country shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic. . Pilz felt that Schwarzeneggers decision not to intervene in the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams had done so. 129 The death penalty in Austria had been abolished in 1968. Environmental record On September 27 2006 Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 creating the nations first cap on greenhouse gas emissions . The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the states greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce Californias emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005 Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. 160 Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17 2006 allowing California to work with the Northeasts Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative . They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009. 161 In addition to using his political power to fight global warming the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home. 162 In respect for his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 SAE World Congress in Detroit on April 20 2009. 163 In 2011 Schwarzenegger founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action to develop a sustainable low-carbon economy . 164 In 2017 he joined French President Emmanuel Macron in calling for the adoption of a Global Pact for the Environment . 165 In 2017 Schwarzenegger launched the Austrian World Summit 166 an international climate conference that is held annually in Vienna Austria. The Austrian World Summit is organized by the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative and aims is to bring together representatives from politics civil society and business to create a broad alliance for climate protection and to identify concrete solutions to the climate crisis.

The Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment in 2003 was widely accredited as the Amend for Arnold bill which would have added an amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run. In 2004 the Amend for Arnold campaign was launched featuring a website and TV advertising promotion. 167 168 In June 2007 Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of Time magazine with Michael Bloomberg and subsequently the two joked about a presidential ticket together. 169 170 Business career Schwarzenegger has also enjoyed a highly successful business career. 24 43 Following his move to the United States Schwarzenegger became a prolific goal setter and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards like starting a mail order business or buying a new car and succeed in doing so. 37 As a result of his early business and investment success Schwarzenegger became a millionaire by the age of 25 well before making a name for himself in Hollywood. His path to financial independence came as a result of his success as a proactive businessman and investor involved with a series of lucrative business ventures and real estate investments. 171 Early ventures In 1968 Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pairs marketing savvy and an increased demand following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake . 172 173 When signs of profitability emerged as business began to pick up Schwarzenegger and Columbu rolled over the profits from their bricklaying venture to go on and start their own mail-order business that sold bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes. 17 172 Investments Schwarzenegger transferred profits from the mail-order business and his bodybuilding-competition winnings by rolling the proceeds into his first real estate investment: an apartment building he purchased for 10 000. Schwarzenegger made millions of dollars by investing in a variety of real estate holding companies both within the United States and around the world. 174 175 Schwarzenegger and fellow Hollywood veteran actor and industry adversary Sylvester Stallone brought their long-storied industry rivalry to an end by both investing in the Planet Hollywood 72 chain of international theme restaurants modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe along with Bruce Willis and Demi Moore . However Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the chain in early 2000. 176 177 Schwarzenegger remarked that the restaurant did not achieve the success that he had hoped for claiming he wanted to focus his attention on new US global business ventures and his then-burgeoning acting career. 176 Schwarzenegger also made a private commercial real estate investment in the Easton Town Center a shopping mall based in Columbus Ohio . 178 He has talked about some of the mentors who have helped him over the years in business: I couldnt have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from Milton Friedman to Donald Trump ... and now Les Wexner and Warren Buffett . I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood such as when to get out! And I did! 33 He has significant equity ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors an Austin-based investment firm. 179 Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnolds Sports Festival a sports and fitness festival which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus Ohio.

I now have 50 million but I was just as happy when I had 48 million. 24 In 2003 Schwarzeneggers net worth was conservatively estimated at 100 million to 200 million. 185 After separating from his wife Maria Shriver in 2011 it was estimated that his net worth had been approximately 400 million and even as high as 800 million based on tax returns he filed in 2006. 186 Commercial advertisements Schwarzenegger has also appeared in a series of commercials for the Machine Zone game Mobile Strike as a military commander and spokesman. 187 Personal life Early relationships In 1969 Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland later Barbara Outland Baker an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974. 188 The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. 37 They shared an apartment in Santa Monica California for three and a half years and having little money they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard. 37 Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger he had little understanding of polite society and she found him a turn-off she says Hes as much a self-made man as its possible to behe never got encouragement from his parents his family his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself and that was very attractive ... Ill go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me. 37 Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary solid life and I was not a well-balanced man and hated the very idea of ordinary life. 188 Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a joyful personality totally charismatic adventurous and athletic but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became insufferableclassically conceitedthe world revolved around him . 189 Baker published her memoir in 2006 entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak . 190 Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword and also met with Baker for three hours. 190 Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. 190 Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. 190 Schwarzenegger met his next lover Beverly Hills hairdressers assistant Sue Moray on Venice Beach in July 1977. According to Moray the couple led an open relationship : We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town we were free to do whatever we wanted. 25 Schwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver niece of President John F. Kennedy at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978 when Moray who knew of his relationship with Shriver issued an ultimatum. 25 Marriage and family Schwarzenegger with then-wife Maria Shriver at the 2007 Special Olympics in Shanghai On April 26 1986 Schwarzenegger married Shriver in Hyannis Massachusetts . 191 They have four children: Katherine 1989 Christina 1991 Patrick 1993 and Christopher 1997. 192 193 194 195 All of their children were born in Los Angeles. 196 The family lived in an 11 000-square-foot 1 000 m 2 home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles California 197 198 with vacation homes in Sun Valley Idaho and Hyannis Port Massachusetts . 199 They attended St. Monicas Catholic Church . 200 Divorce Schwarzenegger and his son Patrick at Edwards Air Force Base in December 2002 On May 9 2011 Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage with Shriver moving out of their Brentwood mansion. 201 202 203 Pursuant to the divorce judgment Schwarzenegger kept the Brentwood home while Shriver purchased a new home nearby so that the children could travel between their parents homes. They shared custody of the two youngest children. 204 Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorneys fees. 92 However he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them. 92 He filed amended divorce papers remedying this. 92 205 Schwarzenegger and Shriver finalized their divorce in 2021 ten years after separating. 206 In June 2022 a jury ruled that Maria Shriver was entitled to half of her ex-husbands post-divorce savings that he earned from 1986 to 2011 including a pension. 207 On May 16 2011 the Los Angeles Times revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son Joseph more than 14 years earlier with an employee in their household Mildred Patricia Patty Baena. 208 209 210 After leaving the governors office I told my wife about this event which occurred over a decade ago Schwarzenegger said to the Times . In the statement Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after she had confronted him with the information which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child. 211 Baena is of Guatemalan origin. She was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011. 212 The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couples four children. 213 Baenas son with Schwarzenegger was born five days after Shriver gave birth. 214 215 Schwarzenegger said that it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy started looking like him ... that he put things together . 216 Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child from the start and continued to provide support . 217 KNX 1070 radio reported that in 2010 he bought a new four-bedroom house with a pool for Baena and their son in Bakersfield California . 218 Baena separated from her husband Rogelio a few months after Joseph s birth.

Schwarzenegger replied Im least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up. 221 222 223 224 Accidents injuries and other health problems Health problems Schwarzenegger was born with a bicuspid aortic valve an aortic valve with only two leaflets where a normal aortic valve has three. 225 226 He opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made from his own pulmonary valve which itself was replaced with a cadaveric pulmonic valve in a Ross procedure ; medical experts predicted he would require pulmonic heart valve replacement surgery within the next two to eight years because his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise. 227 On March 29 2018 Schwarzenegger underwent emergency open-heart surgery for replacement of his replacement pulmonic valve. 228 He said about his recovery: I underwent open-heart surgery this spring I had to use a walker. I had to do breathing exercises five times a day to retrain my lungs. I was frustrated and angry and in my worst moments I couldnt see the way back to my old self. 229 In 2020 23 years after his first surgery Schwarzenegger underwent a surgery for a new aortic valve. 230 Accidents and injuries On December 9 2001 he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles. 231 Schwarzenegger saved a drowning man in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore. 232 On January 8 2006 while Schwarzenegger was riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle in Los Angeles with his son Patrick in the sidecar another driver backed into the street he was riding on causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed Schwarzenegger sustained an injury to his lip requiring 15 stitches. No citations were issued said Officer Jason Lee a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. 233 Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3 2006. 234 Schwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley Idaho with his family on December 23 2006. 235 On December 26 he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from St. Johns Hospital and Health Center on December 30 2006. 236 Schwarzeneggers private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19 2009 after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit according to a statement released by his press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident. 237 On May 18 2019 while on a visit to South Africa Schwarzenegger was attacked and dropkicked from behind by an unknown malefactor while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools. Despite the surprise and unprovoked nature of the attack he reportedly suffered no injuries and continued to interact with fans. The attacker was apprehended and Schwarzenegger declined to press charges against him. 238 239 240 Schwarzenegger was involved in a multi-vehicle collision on the afternoon of Friday January 21 2022. Schwarzenegger was driving a black GMC Yukon SUV near the intersections of Sunset Boulevard and Allenford Avenue in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles when his vehicle collided with a red Toyota Prius . The driver of the Prius was transported to the hospital for injuries sustained to her head. Schwarzenegger was uninjured. 241 242 243 Height Schwarzeneggers official height of 6 ft 2 in 1.88 m has been brought into question by several articles. During his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s it was claimed that he measured 6 ft 1.5 in 1.867 m. However in 1988 both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter. 244 Prior to running for governor Schwarzeneggers height was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader . 245 As governor Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to in his own words settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is by using a tailors tape measure on the Governor. 246 Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words Need a lift? on the five-foot-five-inch 1.65 m Wessons chair before a negotiating session in his office. 247 Democrat Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5 ft 10 in 1.78 m and that he wore risers in his boots. 248 In 1999 Mens Health magazine stated his height was 5 ft 10 in 1.78 m. 249 Autobiography Schwarzeneggers autobiography Total Recall was released in October 2012.

Vehicles Growing up during Allied-occupied Austria Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child. 251 As a result he paid 20 000 to bring his Austrian Army M47 Patton tank 331 to the United States 252 which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965. However he later obtained his vehicle in 19912 253 during his tenure as the Chairmen of the Presidents Council on Sports Fitness and Nutrition 254 and now uses it to support his charity. 253 His first car ever was an Opel Kadett in 1969 after serving in the Austrian army then he rode a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy in 1991. 255 Moreover he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a Humvee . He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvees manufacturer AM General to produce a street-legal civilian version which they did in 1992; the first two Hummer H1s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010 he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for hydrogen one for vegetable oil and one for biodiesel . 256 Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse.

During the gubernatorial recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about 21 000. After the election he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network and gained a United States Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US91 000 000 cost. 259 California took delivery of the first H2H Hydrogen Hummer in October 2004. 260 Public image and legacy Schwarzenegger with Russian powerlifter Maryana Naumova at the Arnold Sports Festival 2013 Schwarzenegger at Camp Buehring in Kuwait in 2016 Schwarzenegger has been involved with the Special Olympics for many years after they were founded in 1968 by his later mother-in-law Eunice Kennedy Shriver . 261 In 2007 Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics held in Shanghai China. 262 Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them. 263 In 1995 he founded the Inner City Games Foundation ICG which provides cultural educational and community enrichment programming to youth.

When I became governor Israel was the first country that I visited.
