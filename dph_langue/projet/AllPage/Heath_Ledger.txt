Mr. Ledger magically and mysteriously disappears beneath the skin of his lean sinewy character. It is a great screen performance as good as the best of Marlon Brando and Sean Penn . 25 In a review in Rolling Stone Peter Travers states: Ledgers magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesnt just know how Ennis moves speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jacks closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost. 26 After Brokeback Mountain Ledger costarred with fellow Australian Abbie Cornish in the 2006 Australian film Candy an adaptation of the 1998 novel Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction as young heroin addicts in love attempting to break free of their addiction whose mentor is played by Geoffrey Rush ; for his performance as sometime poet Dan Ledger was nominated for three Best Actor awards including one of the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards which both Cornish and Rush won in their categories. Shortly after the release of Candy Ledger was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . 27 As one of six actors embodying different aspects of the life of Bob Dylan in the 2007 film Im Not There directed by Todd Haynes Ledger won praise for his portrayal of Robbie Clark a moody counter-culture actor who represents the romanticist side of Dylan but says accolades are never his motivation . 28 Posthumously on 23 February 2008 he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the films ensemble cast its director and its casting director. 29 In his penultimate film role Ledger played the Joker in Christopher Nolan s 2008 film The Dark Knight which was released nearly six months after his death. While working on the film in London Ledger told Sarah Lyall in their New York Times interview that he viewed The Dark Knight s Joker as a psychopathic mass murdering schizophrenic clown with zero empathy . 30 For his performance in The Dark Knight Ledger posthumously won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor becoming the fourth-youngest winner of the award which his family accepted on his behalf as well as numerous other posthumous awards including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor which Nolan accepted for him. 31 32 At the time of his death on 22 January 2008 Ledger had completed about half of the work for his final film role as Tony in Terry Gilliam s The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus . 33 34 Gilliam chose to adapt the film after his death by having fellow actors and friends of Ledger Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell play fantasy transformations of his character so that Ledgers final performance could be seen in theatres. 35 Directorial work Ledger far right posing with the cast and the director of Im Not There at the 64th Venice Film Festival in September 2007 Ledger had aspirations to become a film director and had made some music videos with his production company The Masses which director Todd Haynes praised highly in his tribute to Ledger upon accepting the ISP Robert Altman Award which Ledger posthumously shared on 23 February 2008. 29 36 In 2006 Ledger directed music videos for the title track on Australian hip hop artist Nfa s CD debut solo album Cause An Effect 37 and for the single Seduction Is Evil Shes Hot . 38 39 Later that year Ledger inaugurated a new record label The Masses Music with singer Ben Harper and also directed a music video for Harpers song Morning Yearning . 30 40 At a news conference at the 2007 Venice Film Festival Ledger spoke of his desire to make a documentary film about the British singer-songwriter Nick Drake who died in 1974 at the age of 26 from an overdose of an antidepressant . 41 Ledger created and acted in a music video set to Drakes recording of the singers 1974 song about depression Black Eyed Dog a title inspired by Winston Churchill s descriptive term for depression black dog ; 42 it was shown publicly only twice first at the Bumbershoot Festival in Seattle held from 1 to 3 September 2007; and secondly as part of A Place To Be: A Celebration of Nick Drake with its screening of Their Place: Reflections On Nick Drake a series of short filmed homages to Nick Drake including Ledgers sponsored by American Cinematheque at the Graumans Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood on 5 October 2007. 43 After Ledgers death his music video for Black Eyed Dog was shown on the Internet and excerpted in news clips distributed via YouTube. 41 44 45 a He was working with Scottish screenwriter and producer Allan Scott on an adaptation of the 1983 novel The Queens Gambit by Walter Tevis which would have been his first feature film as a director. He also intended to act in the film with Canadian actor Elliot Page proposed in the lead role. 2 46 47 Ledgers final directorial work in which he shot two music videos before his death premiered in 2009. 48 The music videos completed for Modest Mouse and Grace Woodroofe 49 include an animated feature for Modest Mouses song King Rat and the Woodroofe video for her cover of David Bowie s Quicksand . 50 The King Rat video premiered on 4 August 2009. 51 Personal life Ledger at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2006 Ledger was an avid chess player and had participated in tournaments when he was young. 52 As an adult he often played with other chess enthusiasts at Washington Square Park in Manhattan. 53 He was a fan of West Coast Eagles an Australian rules football team that competes in the Australian Football League AFL and is based in his hometown of Perth. 54 Ledger was an obsessive photographer who loved taking stills then drawing over them with paint markers or nail polish . 55 Relationships Ledger dated Lisa Zane Christina Cauchi Heather Graham and Naomi Watts . 56 57 In 2004 he began a relationship with actress Michelle Williams after meeting her on the set of Brokeback Mountain . Their daughter Matilda Rose was born on 28 October 2005 in New York City. 58 Matildas godparents are Brokeback Mountain co-star Jake Gyllenhaal and Williams Dawsons Creek co-star Busy Philipps . 59 In January 2006 Ledger listed his residence in Bronte New South Wales for sale 60 and returned to the US where he shared a house with Williams in Boerum Hill Brooklyn from 2005 to 2007. 61 In September 2007 Williams father confirmed to The Daily Telegraph that Ledger and Williams had broken up. 62 After his breakup with Williams the tabloid press and other public media linked Ledger romantically with supermodels Helena Christensen and Gemma Ward . In 2011 Ward stated that the pair had begun dating in November 2007 and that their families had spent that years Christmas together in their hometown of Perth. 63 64 65 66 67 68 Press controversies Ledgers relationship with the Australian press was sometimes turbulent and it led to his abandonment of plans for his family to reside part-time in Sydney. 69 70 In 2004 he strongly denied press reports alleging that he spat at journalists on the Sydney set of the film Candy or that one of his relatives had done so later outside Ledgers Sydney home. 69 70 On 13 January 2006 Several members of the paparazzi retaliated ... squirting Ledger and Williams with water pistols on the red carpet at the Sydney premiere of Brokeback Mountain . 71 72 After his performance on stage at the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Awards when he had giggled in presenting Brokeback Mountain as a nominee for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture the Los Angeles Times referred to his presentation as an apparent gay spoof . 73 Ledger called the Times later and explained that his levity resulted from stage fright saying that he had been told that he would be presenting the award only minutes earlier; he stated: I am so sorry and I apologise for my nervousness. I would be absolutely horrified if my stage fright was misinterpreted as a lack of respect for the film the topic and for the amazing filmmakers. 74 75 After learning that two cinemas in Utah refused to show Brokeback Mountain Ledger said: I dont think the movie is controversial but I think maybe the Mormons in Utah do. I think its hilarious and very immature of a society . 76 In the same interview with the Herald Sun newspaper Ledger mistakenly claimed that lynchings had occurred in West Virginia as recently as the 1980s; state scholars disputed his statement asserting that no documented lynchings had occurred in West Virginia since 1931. 77 Health problems and drug use In an interview with Sarah Lyall published in The New York Times on 4 November 2007 Ledger stated that he often could not sleep when taking on roles and that the role of the Joker in The Dark Knight 2008 was causing his usual insomnia: Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night. ... I couldnt stop thinking. My body was exhausted and my mind was still going. 78 At that time he told Lyall that he had taken two Ambien pills after taking just one had not sufficed and those left him in a stupor only to wake up an hour later his mind still racing . 30 Prior to his return to New York City from his last film assignment in London in January 2008 while he was apparently suffering from some kind of respiratory illness he reportedly complained to his The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus co-star Christopher Plummer that he was continuing to have difficulty sleeping and taking pills to help with that problem: Confirming earlier reports that Ledger hadnt been feeling well on set Plummer said: we all caught colds because we were shooting outside on horrible damp nights. But Heaths went on and I dont think he dealt with it immediately with the antibiotics .... I think what he did have was the walking pneumonia . ... On top of that He was saying all the time dammit I cant sleep... and he was taking all these pills to help him . 79 Speaking to Interview magazine after Ledgers death Michelle Williams confirmed reports that the actor had experienced trouble sleeping: For as long as Id known him he had bouts with insomnia. He had too much energy. His mind was turning turning turning always turning . 80 Ledger was widely reported to have struggled with substance abuse . 81 Following Ledgers death Entertainment Tonight aired video footage from 2006 in which Ledger stated that he used to smoke five joints a day for 20 years 82 83 and news outlets reported that his drug abuse had prompted Williams to request that he move out of their apartment in Brooklyn. 84 Ledgers publicist asserted that reportage regarding Ledgers alleged drug use had been inaccurate. 82 Death At around 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday 22 January 2008 Ledger was found naked and lying face down unresponsive in his bed by his housekeeper Teresa Solomon and his massage therapist Diana Wolozin in his loft at 421 Broome Street in the SoHo neighbourhood of Manhattan . 6 4 85 According to police Wolozin who had arrived early for a 3 p.m. appointment with Ledger telephoned his friend Mary-Kate Olsen for help. Olsen who was in Los Angeles at the time directed her New York City private security guard to go to the scene. At 3:26 p.m. less than 15 minutes after she first saw him in bed and only a few moments after the first call to Ms. Olsen Wolozin dialed 911 to say that Mr. Ledger was not breathing . At the urging of the 911 operator Wolozin administered CPR which was unsuccessful in reviving him. 86 Paramedics and emergency medical technicians arrived seven minutes later at 3:33 p.m. but were also unable to revive him. 6 86 87 At 3:36 p.m. Ledger was pronounced dead and his body was removed from the apartment. 6 86 He was 28 years old. Autopsy and toxicology report On 6 February 2008 the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York released its conclusions. Those conclusions were based on an initial autopsy that occurred 23 January 2008 and a subsequent complete toxicological analysis . 7 88 89 The report concluded that Ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone hydrocodone diazepam temazepam alprazolam and doxylamine . It added: We have concluded that the manner of death is accidental resulting from the abuse of prescribed medications. 7 9 While the medications found in the toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for insomnia anxiety pain or common cold symptoms doxylamine the vast majority of the countrys physicians would be extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple benzodiazepines e.g. diazepam alprazolam and temazepam to a single patient let alone to prescribe such medications to a patient already taking a mix of oxycodone and hydrocodone. Use of opioids with benzodiazepines which depress the central nervous system creates a serious risk of slowed breathing and death. 90 Although the Associated Press and other outlets reported that police estimated Ledgers death occurred between 1 p.m. and 2:45 p.m. on 22 January 2008 91 the Medical Examiners Office announced that it would not publicly disclose the official estimated time of death. 92 93 The official announcement of the cause and manner of Ledgers death heightened concerns about the growing problems of prescription drug abuse or misuse and combined drug intoxication CDI. 8 89 94 In 2017 Jason Payne-James a forensic pathologist asserted that Ledger might have survived if hydrocodone and oxycodone had been left out of the combination of drugs that the actor took just prior to his death. He furthermore stated that the mixture of drugs combined with a possible chest infection caused Ledger to stop breathing. 95 Federal investigation Late in February 2008 a DEA investigation of medical professionals relating to Ledgers death exonerated two American physicians who practice in Los Angeles and Houston of any wrongdoing determining that the doctors in question had prescribed Ledger other medications not the pills that killed him. 96 97 On 4 August 2008 Mary-Kate Olsens attorney Michael Miller issued a statement denying that Olsen supplied Ledger with the drugs causing his death and asserting that she did not know their source. 98 99 In his statement Miller said specifically Despite tabloid speculation Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them. 100 After a flurry of further media speculation on 6 August 2008 the US Attorneys Office in Manhattan closed its investigation into Ledgers death without filing any charges and rendering moot its subpoena of Olsen. 101 102 With the clearing of the two doctors and Olsen and the closing of the investigation because the prosecutors in the Manhattan US Attorneys Office dont believe theres a viable target it is still not known how Ledger obtained the oxycodone and hydrocodone in the lethal drug combination that killed him. 102 103 Controversy over will After Ledgers death in response to some press reports about his will filed in New York City on 28 February 2008 104 105 and his daughters access to his financial legacy his father Kim Ledger said that he considered the financial well-being of Heaths daughter Matilda Rose an absolute priority whilst also stating that her mother Michelle Williams was an integral part of our family . He added They will be taken care of and thats how Heath would want it to be . 106 Some of Ledgers relatives may be challenging the legal status of his will signed in 2003 prior to his involvement with Williams and the birth of their daughter and not updated to include them which divides half of his estate between his parents and half among his siblings; they claim that there is a second unsigned will which leaves most of that estate to Matilda Rose. 107 108 Williams father Larry Williams has also joined the controversy about Ledgers will as it was filed in New York City soon after his death. 109 On 31 March 2008 stimulating another controversy pertaining to Ledgers estate Gemma Jones and Janet Fife-Yeomans published an Exclusive report in The Daily Telegraph citing Ledgers uncle Haydn Ledger and other family members who believe the late actor may have fathered a secret love child when he was 17 and stating that If it is confirmed that Ledger is the girls biological father it could split his multi-million dollar estate between ... Matilda Rose ... and his secret love child. 110 111 112 A few days later reports citing telephone interviews with Ledgers uncles Haydn and Mike Ledger and the family of the other little girl published in OK! and Us Weekly denied those claims with Ledgers uncles and the little girls mother and stepfather describing them as unfounded rumors distorted and exaggerated by the media. 113 114 On 15 July 2008 Fife-Yeomans reported further via Australian News Limited that While Ledger left everything to his parents and three sisters it is understood they have legal advice that under Western Australia law Matilda Rose is entitled to the lions share of his estate; its executors Kim Ledgers former business colleague Robert John Collins and Geraldton accountant William Mark Dyson have applied for probate in the West Australian Supreme Court in Perth advertising for creditors and other persons having claims on the estate to lodge them by 11 August 2008 ... to ensure all debts are paid before the estate is distributed.... 115 According to this report by Fife-Yeomans earlier reports citing Ledgers uncles 106 and subsequent reports citing Ledgers father which do not include his actual posthumous earnings his entire fortune mostly held in Australian trusts is likely to be worth up to 20 million. 115 116 117 On 27 September 2008 Ledgers father Kim stated that the family has agreed to leave the US16.3 million fortune to Matilda adding: There is no claim. Our family has gifted everything to Matilda. 116 117 In October 2008 Forbes estimated Ledgers annual earnings from October 2007 through October 2008 including his posthumous share of The Dark Knight s gross income of US1 billion in box office revenue worldwide as US20 million . 118 Legacy Memorial tributes and services Memorial for Ledger outside 421 Broome Street SoHo Manhattan 23 January 2008 As the news of Ledgers death became public throughout the night of 22 January 2008 and the following day media crews mourners fans and other onlookers began gathering outside his apartment building with some leaving flowers or other memorial tributes. 119 120 The following day at 10:50am AWST Ledgers parents and sister appeared outside his mothers house in Applecross a riverside suburb of Perth and read a short statement to the media expressing their grief and desire for privacy. 121 Within the next few days memorial tributes were communicated by family members; Kevin Rudd then- Prime Minister of Australia ; Eric Ripper then- Deputy Premier of Western Australia ; Warner Bros. distributor of The Dark Knight and thousands of Ledgers fans around the world. 122 123 124 125 Several actors made statements expressing their sorrow at Ledgers death including Daniel Day-Lewis who dedicated his Screen Actors Guild Award to him saying that he was inspired by Ledgers acting; Day-Lewis praised Ledgers performances in Monsters Ball and Brokeback Mountain describing the latter as unique perfect . 126 127 Verne Troyer who was working with Ledger on The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus at the time of his death had a heart shape an exact duplicate of a symbol that Ledger scrawled on a piece of paper with his email address tattooed on his hand in remembrance of Ledger because Ledger had made such an impression on him . 128 On 1 February in her first public statement after Ledgers death Michelle Williams expressed her heartbreak and described Ledgers spirit as surviving in their daughter. 129 130 After attending private memorial ceremonies in Los Angeles Ledgers family members returned with his body to Perth . 131 132 On 9 February a memorial service attended by several hundred invited guests was held at Penrhos College attracting considerable press attention; afterward Ledgers body was cremated at Fremantle Cemetery 133 followed by a private service attended by only 10 of his closest family members 134 135 136 The ashes were taken from Fremantle for interment at an unspecified location. 137 Later that night his family and friends gathered for a wake on Cottesloe Beach . 138 139 140 The Eskimo Joe song Foreign Land was written as a tribute to Ledger. 141 The band were in New York at the time of his death. In January 2011 the State Theatre Centre of Western Australia in Ledgers home town of Perth named a 575-seat theatre the Heath Ledger Theatre after him. For the opening of the theatre Ledgers Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor was on display in the theatres foyer along with his Joker costume. 142 Bon Iver s Perth was inspired by Heath Ledger. 143 Justin Vernon the lead singer and songwriter of the American indie folk band revealed back in 2011 that he had begun working on the song in 2008 and was scheduled to meet with a music video director who was good friends with Ledger Matt Amato. The first thing I worked on the riff and the beginning melodies was the first song on the record Perth Vernon told Exclaim! . 144 Amato was directing the bands The Wolves Act I II music video the day that Ledger died. It was no longer about just making a Bon Iver music video anymore Vernon says. This was now our chance to be there with Matt as he grieved. It was a three-day wake. Amato told Vernon stories about Ledger that eventually became the inspiration for Perth the opening track to the bands second studio album Bon Iver Bon Iver 2011. 143 Method and style Ledger on the March 2006 cover of Rolling Stone You know when you see the preachers down South? And they grab a believer and they go Bwoom! I touch you with the hand of God! And they believe so strongly theyre on the ground shaking and spitting. And fucks sake thats the power of belief... Now I dont believe in Jesus but I believe in my performance. And if you can understand that the power of belief is one of the great tools of our time and that a lot of acting comes from it you can do anything. Ledger during the interview with Rolling Stone in 2006 on belief power and acting 145 Portraying a variety of roles from romantic heroes to tragic characters Ledger created a hodgepodge of characters that are deliberately unlike one another stating: I feel like I am wasting my time if I repeat myself . He also reflected on his inability to be happy with his work I feel the same thing about everything I do. The day I say Its good is the day I should start doing something else. 146 Ledger liked to wait between jobs so that he would start creatively hungry on new projects. 147 In his own words acting was about harnessing the infinite power of belief 145 thus using belief as a tool for creating. Directors who have worked with the actor praised him for his creativity seriousness and intuition. Ive never felt as old as I did watching Heath explore his talents The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan has written expressing amazement over the actors working process genuine curiosity and charisma. 147 Marc Forster who directed Ledger in Monsters Ball complimented him as taking the job very seriously being disciplined observant understanding and intuitive. In 2007 director Todd Haynes compared Ledgers presence to actor James Dean casting Ledger as Robbie Clarke a fictive personification of Bob Dylan in Im Not There . Drawing on the similar characteristics between the actors Haynes further highlighted Ledgers precocious seriousness and intuition. He also felt that Ledger had a rare maturity beyond his years. 146 Ledger however disconnected himself and acting from perfectionism. Im always gonna pull myself apart and dissect the work. I mean theres no such thing as perfection in what actors do. Pornos are more perfect than we are because theyre actually fucking. 145 Some people find their shtick Ledger reflected on the categorisation of style. I never figured out who Heath Ledger is on film: This is what you expect when you hire me and it will be recognisable... People always feel compelled to sum you up to presume that they have you and can describe you. Thats fine. But there are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note. 146 Posthumous films and awards Further information: List of accolades received by The Dark Knight Ledgers death affected the marketing campaign for Christopher Nolan s The Dark Knight 2008 11 33 and also both the production and marketing of Terry Gilliam s film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus with both directors intending to celebrate and pay tribute to his work in these films. 33 34 148 149 Although Gilliam temporarily suspended production on the latter film 34 he expressed determination to salvage it perhaps using computer-generated imagery CGI and dedicated it to Ledger. 79 150 151 In February 2008 as a memorial tribute to the man many have called one of the best actors of his generation Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell signed on to take over Ledgers role becoming multiple incarnations of his character Tony transformed in this magical re-telling of the Faust story . 152 153 154 The three actors donated their fees for the film to Ledgers and Williamss daughter. 155 Speaking of editing The Dark Knight on which Ledger had completed his work in October 2007 Nolan recalled It was tremendously emotional right when he passed having to go back in and look at him every day. ... But the truth is I feel very lucky to have something productive to do to have a performance that he was very very proud of and that he had entrusted to me to finish. 149 All of Ledgers scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film Nolan added no digital effects to alter Ledgers actual performance posthumously. 156 Nolan dedicated the film in part to Ledgers memory as well as to the memory of technician Conway Wickliffe who was killed during a car accident while preparing one of the films stunts. 157 Released in July 2008 The Dark Knight broke several box office records and received both popular and critical accolades especially with regard to Ledgers performance as the Joker. 158 Even film critic David Denby who does not praise the film overall in his pre-release review in The New Yorker evaluates Ledgers work highly describing his performance as both sinister and frightening and Ledger as mesmerising in every scene concluding: His performance is a heroic unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss. 159 Attempting to dispel widespread speculations that Ledgers performance as the Joker had in any way led to his death as Denby and others suggest Ledgers co-star and friend Christian Bale who played opposite him as Batman has stressed that as an actor Ledger greatly enjoyed meeting the challenges of creating that role an experience that Ledger himself described as the most fun Ive ever had or probably ever will have playing a character . 11 Terry Gilliam also refuted the claims that playing the Joker made him crazy calling it absolute nonsense and going on to say Heath was so solid. His feet were on the ground and he was the least neurotic person Ive ever met. 160 Ledger received numerous awards for his Joker role in The Dark Knight . On 10 November 2008 he was nominated for two Peoples Choice Awards related to his work on the film Best Ensemble Cast and Best Onscreen Match-Up shared with Christian Bale and Ledger won an award for Match-Up in the ceremony aired live on CBS in January 2009. 161 On 11 December 2008 it was announced that Ledger had been nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor Motion Picture for his performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight ; he subsequently won the award at the 66th Golden Globe Awards ceremony telecast on NBC on 11 January 2009 with Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan accepting on his behalf. 10 31 Film critics co-stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine and many of Ledgers peers in the film community joined Bale in calling for and predicting a nomination for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in recognition of Ledgers achievement in The Dark Knight . 162 Ledgers subsequent nomination was announced on 22 January 2009 the anniversary of his death. 163 Ledger went on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor becoming the second person to win a posthumous Academy Award for acting after fellow Australian actor Peter Finch who won for 1976s Network as well as the first comic-book movie actor to win an Oscar for their acting. Ledgers family attended the ceremony on 22 February 2009 with his parents and sister accepting the award onstage on his behalf. 164 32 Following talks with the Ledger family in Australia the academy determined that Ledgers daughter Matilda Rose would own the award. However due to Matildas age she would not gain full ownership of the statuette until her eighteenth birthday in 2023. 165 Her mother Michelle Williams would hold the statuette in trust for Matilda until that time. 166 On 4 April 2017 a trailer was released for the documentary I Am Heath Ledger which was released on 3 May 2017. 167 It features archival footage of Ledger and interviews. 168 Filmography Film Year Title Role Notes 1997 Blackrock Toby Ackland Paws Oberon 1999 10 Things I Hate About You Patrick Verona Two Hands Jimmy 2000 The Patriot Gabriel Martin 2001 A Knights Tale William Thatcher Monsters Ball Sonny Grotowski 2002 The Four Feathers Harry Faversham 2003 Ned Kelly Ned Kelly The Order Alex Bernier 2005 Brokeback Mountain Ennis Del Mar The Brothers Grimm Jacob Grimm Casanova Giacomo Casanova Lords of Dogtown Skip Engblom 2006 Candy Dan Carter 2007 Im Not There Robbie Clark Bob Dylan 2008 The Dark Knight The Joker Posthumous release 2009 The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus Tony Shepard Posthumous release; final film role Television Year Title Role Notes 1992 Clowning Around Orphan clown TV movie; debut role uncredited 1993 Ship to Shore Cyclist Seasons 12 3 episodes 1996 Sweat Snowy Bowles Season 1 26 episodes 1997 Home and Away Scott Irwin Season 10 9 episodes Roar Conor Season 1 13 episodes 2017 I Am Heath Ledger Himself Posthumous release; archive footage Music videos Year Title Performer Notes 2006 Cause an Effect Nfa Also director Seduction is Evil Shes Hot Morning Yearning Ben Harper 2007 Black Eyed Dog Nick Drake Also director and featuring himself 41 2009 Quicksand Grace Woodroofe Also director King Rat Modest Mouse Animated video; conceived by himself 49 Accolades Main article: List of awards and nominations received by Heath Ledger See also List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees Youngest nominees for Best Actor in a Leading Role List of actors with Academy Award nominations List of actors with two or more Academy Award nominations in acting categories List of Australian Academy Award winners and nominees List of posthumous Academy Award winners and nominees Notes Drakes song Black Eyed Dog is featured as track number five on the soundtrack album for the 1998 film Practical Magic directed by Griffin Dunne and starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman .
