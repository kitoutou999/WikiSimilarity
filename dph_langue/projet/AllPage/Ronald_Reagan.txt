A member of the Republican Party he became an important figure in the American conservative movement and his presidency is known as the Reagan era . Born and raised in Illinois Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and later worked as a sports broadcaster in Iowa. In 1937 he moved to California where he became a well-known film actor. During his acting career Reagan twice served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952 and from 1959 to 1960. In the 1950s he began working on television and became a spokesman for General Electric . Subsequently Reagans A Time for Choosing speech during the 1964 U.S. presidential election launched his rise as a leading conservative figure. After being elected governor of California in 1966 he raised the state taxes turned the state budget deficit into a surplus and implemented harsh crackdowns on university protests. Following his loss to Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries Reagan won the Republican Partys nomination and then a landslide victory over President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election . In his first term as U.S. president Reagan began implementing Reaganomics which involved economic deregulation and cuts in both taxes and government spending during a period of stagflation . On the world stage he escalated the arms race transitioned Cold War policy away from the policies of detente with the Soviet Union and ordered the 1983 invasion of Grenada . Within the same period Reagan also survived an assassination attempt fought public-sector labor unions expanded the war on drugs and was slow to respond to the growing AIDS epidemic . In the 1984 presidential election he defeated Carters former vice president Walter Mondale in another landslide victory. Foreign affairs dominated Reagans second term including the 1986 bombing of Libya the secret and illegal sale of arms to Iran to fund the Contras and a more conciliatory approach in talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev culminating in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty . Reagan left the presidency in 1989 with the American economy having seen a significant reduction of inflation the unemployment rate having fallen and the U.S. having entered its then-longest peacetime expansion. At the same time the national debt had nearly tripled since 1981 as a result of his cuts in taxes and increased military spending despite cuts to domestic discretionary spending. Reagans policies also contributed to the end of the Cold War and the end of Soviet communism . 8 Alzheimers disease hindered Reagan post-presidency and his physical and mental capacities gradually deteriorated ultimately leading to his death in 2004. Historical rankings of U.S. presidents have typically placed Reagan in the upper tier and his post-presidential approval ratings by the general public are usually high. 9 Early life Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6 1911 in a commercial building in Tampico Illinois as the younger son of Nelle Clyde Wilson and Jack Reagan . 10 Nelle was committed to the Disciples of Christ 11 which believed in the Social Gospel . 12 She led prayer meetings and ran mid-week prayers at her church when the pastor was out of town. 11 Reagan credited her spiritual influence 13 and he became a Christian . 14 According to American political figure Stephen Vaughn Reagans values came from his pastor and the First Christian Churchs religious economic and social positions coincided with the words if not the beliefs of the latter-day Reagan . 15 Jack focused on making money to take care of the family 10 but this was complicated by his alcoholism. 16 Reagan had an older brother Neil . 17 The family lived in Chicago Galesburg and Monmouth before returning to Tampico. In 1920 they settled in Dixon Illinois 18 living in a house near the H. C. Pitney Variety Store Building . 19 Reagan attended Dixon High School where he developed interests in drama and football . 20 His first job involved working as a lifeguard at the Rock River in Lowell Park . 21 In 1928 Reagan began attending Eureka College 22 at Nelles approval on religious grounds. 23 He was a mediocre student 24 who participated in sports drama and campus politics. He became student body president and joined a student strike that resulted in the college presidents resignation. 25 Reagan was initiated as a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and served as president of the local chapter. 26 Reagan played at the guard position for the 1930 and 1931 Eureka Red Devils football teams and recalled a time when two black football teammates were refused service at a segregated hotel; he invited them to his parents home nearby in Dixon and his parents welcomed them. At the time his parents stance on racial questions was unusually progressive in Dixon. 27 Reagan himself had grown up with very few black Americans there and was oblivious to racial discrimination. 28 Entertainment career Further information: Ronald Reagan filmography Radio and film Dark Victory 1939 The Bad Man 1941 After obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology from Eureka College in 1932 29 30 Reagan took a job in Davenport Iowa as a sports broadcaster for four football games in the Big Ten Conference . 31 He then worked for WHO radio in Des Moines as a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs . His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress. 32 Simultaneously he often expressed his opposition to racism. 33 In 1936 while traveling with the Cubs to their spring training in California Reagan took a screen test that led to a seven-year contract with Warner Bros. 34 Reagan arrived at Hollywood in 1937 debuting in Love Is on the Air 1937. 35 Using a simple and direct approach to acting and following his directors instructions 36 Reagan made thirty films mostly B films before beginning military service in April 1942. 37 He broke out of these types of films by portraying George Gipp in Knute Rockne All American 1940 which would be rejuvenated when reporters called Reagan the Gipper while he campaigned for president of the United States. 38 Afterward Reagan starred in Kings Row 1942 as a leg amputee asking Wheres the rest of me? 39 His performance was considered his best by many critics. 40 Reagan became a star 41 with Gallup polls placing him in the top 100 stars from 1941 to 1942. 40 World War II interrupted the movie stardom that Reagan would never be able to achieve again 41 as Warner Bros. became uncertain about his ability to generate ticket sales. Reagan who had a limited acting range was dissatisfied with the roles he received. As a result Lew Wasserman renegotiated his contract with his studio allowing him to also make films with Universal Pictures Paramount Pictures and RKO Pictures as a freelancer. With this Reagan appeared in multiple western films something that had been denied to him while working at Warner Bros. 42 In 1952 he ended his relationship with Warner Bros. 43 but went on to appear in a total of 53 films 37 his last being The Killers 1964. 44 Military service Reagan at Fort Roach between 1943 and 1944 In April 1937 Reagan enlisted in the United States Army Reserve . He was assigned as a private in Des Moines 322nd Cavalry Regiment and reassigned to second lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps. 45 He later became a part of the 323rd Cavalry Regiment in California. 46 As relations between the United States and Japan worsened Reagan was ordered for active duty while he was filming Kings Row . Wasserman and Warner Bros. lawyers successfully sent draft deferments to complete the film in October 1941. However to avoid accusations of Reagan being a draft dodger the studio let him go in April 1942. 47 Reagan reported for duty with severe near-sightedness . His first assignment was at Fort Mason as a liaison officer a role that allowed him to transfer to the United States Army Air Forces AAF. Reagan became an AAF public relations officer and was subsequently assigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit in Culver City 48 where he felt that it was impossible to remove an incompetent or lazy worker due to what he felt was the incompetence the delays and inefficiencies of the federal bureaucracy . 49 Despite this Reagan participated in the Provisional Task Force Show Unit in Burbank 50 and continued to make theatrical films. 51 He was also ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the sixth War Loan Drive before being reassigned to Fort MacArthur until his discharge on December 9 1945 as a captain . Throughout his military service Reagan produced over 400 training films . 50 Screen Actors Guild presidency When Robert Montgomery resigned as president of the Screen Actors Guild SAG on March 10 1947 Reagan was elected to that position in a special election. 52 Reagans first tenure saw various labormanagement disputes 53 the Hollywood blacklist 54 and the TaftHartley Act s implementation. 55 On April 10 the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI interviewed Reagan and he provided them with the names of actors whom he believed to be communist sympathizers . 56 During a House Un-American Activities Committee hearing Reagan testified that some guild members were associated with the Communist Party 57 and that he was well-informed about a jurisdictional strike . 58 When asked if he was aware of communist efforts within the Screen Writers Guild he called information about the efforts hearsay . 59 Reagan resigned as SAG president November 10 1952 but remained on the board; 60 Walter Pidgeon succeeded him as president. 61 The SAG fought with film producers for the right to receive residual payments 62 and on November 16 1959 the board elected Reagan SAG president for the second time; 63 he replaced Howard Keel who had resigned. During this second stint Reagan managed to secure payments for actors whose theatrical films had been released between 1948 and 1959 and subsequently televised. The producers were initially required to pay the actors fees but they ultimately settled instead for providing pensions and paying residuals for films made after 1959. Reagan resigned from the SAG presidency on June 7 1960 and also left the board; 64 George Chandler succeeded him as SAG president. 65 Marriages and children Reagan and Jane Wyman 1942 Ronald and Nancy Reagan 1952 In January 1940 Reagan married Jane Wyman his co-star in the 1938 film Brother Rat . 66 67 Together they had two biological daughters: Maureen in 1941 68 and Christine in 1947 born prematurely and died the following day. 69 They adopted one son Michael in 1945. 49 Wyman filed to divorce Reagan in June 1948. She was uninterested in politics and occasionally recriminated reconciled and separated with him. Although Reagan was unprepared 69 the divorce was finalized in July 1949. Reagan would also remain close to his children. 70 Later that year Reagan met Nancy Davis after she contacted him in his capacity as the SAG president about her name appearing on a communist blacklist in Hollywood ; she had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis. 71 They married in March 1952 72 and had two children Patti in October 1952 and Ron in May 1958. 73 Reagan has three grandchildren. 74 Television Reagan became the host of MCA Inc. television production General Electric Theater 43 at Wassermans recommendation. It featured multiple guest stars 75 and Ronald and Nancy Reagan continuing to use her stage name Nancy Davis acted together in three episodes. 76 When asked how Reagan was able to recruit such stars to appear on the show during televisions infancy he replied Good stories top direction production quality . 77 However the viewership declined in the 1960s and the show was canceled in 1962. 78 In 1965 Reagan became the host 79 of another MCA production Death Valley Days . 80 Early political activities Reagan campaigning with Barry Goldwater 1964 Reagan began his political career as a Democrat viewing Franklin D. Roosevelt as a true hero . 81 He joined the American Veterans Committee and Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts Sciences and Professions HICCASP worked with the AFLCIO to fight right-to-work laws 82 and continued to speak out against racism when he was in Hollywood. 83 In 1945 Reagan planned to lead an HICCASP anti-nuclear rally but Warner Bros. prevented him from going. 84 In 1946 he appeared in a radio program called Operation Terror to speak out against rising Ku Klux Klan activity in the country citing the attacks as a capably organized systematic campaign of fascist violence and intimidation and horror . 85 Reagan also supported Harry S. Truman in the 1948 presidential election 86 and Helen Gahagan Douglas for the U.S. Senate in 1950 . It was Reagans belief that communism was a powerful backstage influence in Hollywood that led him to rally his friends against them. 82 Reagan began shifting to the right when he supported the presidential campaigns of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and Richard Nixon in 1960. 87 When Reagan was contracted by General Electric GE he gave speeches to their employees. His speeches had a positive take on free markets . 88 Under GE vice president Lemuel Boulware a staunch anti-communist 89 employees were encouraged to vote for business-friendly politicians. 90 In 1961 Reagan adapted his speeches into another speech to criticize Medicare . 91 In his view its legislation would have meant the end of individual freedom in the United States . 92 In 1962 Reagan was dropped by GE 93 and he formally registered as a Republican . 87 In the 1964 U.S. presidential election Reagan gave a speech for presidential contender Barry Goldwater 94 that was eventually referred to as A Time for Choosing . 95 Reagan argued that the Founding Fathers knew that governments dont control things. And they knew when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose 96 and that Weve been told increasingly that we must choose between left or right . 97 Even though the speech was not enough to turn around the faltering Goldwater campaign it increased Reagans profile among conservatives. David S. Broder and Stephen H. Hess called it the most successful national political debut since William Jennings Bryan electrified the 1896 Democratic convention with his famous Cross of Gold address . 94 1966 California gubernatorial election Further information: 1966 California gubernatorial election Ronald and Nancy Reagan celebrating his gubernatorial election victory November 1966 In January 1966 Reagan announced his candidacy for the California governorship 98 repeating his stances on individual freedom and big government . 99 When he met with black Republicans in March 100 he was criticized for opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . Reagan responded that bigotry was not in his nature 101 and later argued that certain provisions of the act infringed upon the rights of property owners. 102 After the Supreme Court of California ruled that the initiative that repealed the Rumford Act was unconstitutional in May he voiced his support for the acts repeal 103 but later preferred amending it. 104 In the Republican primary Reagan defeated George Christopher 105 a moderate Republican 106 who William F. Buckley Jr. thought had painted Reagan as extreme. 99 Reagans general election opponent incumbent governor Pat Brown attempted to label Reagan as an extremist and tout his own accomplishments. 107 Reagan portrayed himself as a political outsider 108 and charged Brown as responsible for the Watts riots and lenient on crime. 107 In numerous speeches Reagan hit the Brown administration about high taxes uncontrolled spending the radicals at the University of California Berkeley and the need for accountability in government . 109 Meanwhile many in the press perceived Reagan as monumentally ignorant of state issues though Lou Cannon said that Reagan benefited from an appearance he and Brown made on Meet the Press in September. 110 Ultimately Reagan won the governorship with 57 percent of the vote compared to Browns 42 percent. 111 California governorship 19671975 Main article: Governorship of Ronald Reagan The Reagans in 1972 Brown had spent much of Californias funds on new programs prompting them to use accrual accounting to avoid raising taxes. Consequently it generated a larger deficit 112 and Reagan would call for reduced government spending and tax hikes to balance the budget . 113 He worked with Jesse M. Unruh on securing tax increases and promising future property tax cuts. This caused some conservatives to accuse Reagan of betraying his principles. 114 As a result taxes on sales banks corporate profits inheritances liquor and cigarettes jumped. Kevin Starr states Reagan gave Californians the biggest tax hike in their historyand got away with it . 115 In the 1970 gubernatorial election Unruh used Reagans tax policy against him saying it disproportionally favored the wealthy. Reagan countered that he was still committed to reducing property taxes. 116 By 1973 the budget had a surplus which Reagan preferred to give back to the people . 117 In 1967 Reagan reacted to the Black Panther Party s strategy of copwatching by signing the Mulford Act 118 to prohibit the public carrying of firearms. The act was Californias most restrictive piece of gun control legislation with critics saying that it was overreacting to the political activism of organizations such as the Black Panthers . 119 The act marked the beginning of both modern legislation and public attitude studies on gun control. 118 Reagan also signed the 1967 Therapeutic Abortion Act that allowed abortions in the cases of rape and incest when a doctor determined the birth would impair the physical or mental health of the mother. He later expressed regret over signing it saying that he was unaware of the mental health provision. He believed that doctors were interpreting the provision loosely and more abortions were resulting. 120 After Reagan won the 1966 election he and his advisors planned a run in the 1968 Republican presidential primaries . 121 He ran as an unofficial candidate to cut into Nixons southern support and be a compromise candidate if there were to be a brokered convention . He won Californias delegates 122 but Nixon secured enough delegates for the nomination . 123 Reagan had previously been critical of former governor Brown and university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations in the city of Berkeley making it a major theme in his campaigning. 124 On February 5 1969 Reagan declared a state of emergency in response to ongoing protests and acts of violence at the University of California Berkeley and sent in the California Highway Patrol . In May 1969 these officers along with local officers from Berkeley and Alameda county clashed with protestors over a site known as the Peoples Park . 125 126 One student was shot and killed while many police officers and two reporters were injured. Reagan then commanded the state National Guard troops to occupy Berkeley for seventeen days to subdue the protesters allowing other students to attend class safely. In February 1970 violent protests broke out near the University of California Santa Barbara where he once again deployed the National Guard. On April 7 Reagan defended his policies regarding campus protests saying If it takes a bloodbath lets get it over with. No more appeasement . 127 Governor Reagan meets Dictator Franco during his visit to Spain 11 July 1972 During his victorious reelection campaign in 1970 Reagan remaining critical of government promised to prioritize welfare reform . 128 He was concerned that the programs were disincentivizing work and that the growing welfare rolls would lead to both an unbalanced budget and another big tax hike in 1972. 129 At the same time the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to combat inflation putting the American economy in a mild recession . Reagan worked with Bob Moretti to tighten up the eligibility requirements so that the financially needy could continue receiving payments. This was only accomplished after Reagan softened his criticism of Nixons Family Assistance Plan . Nixon then lifted regulations to shepherd Californias experiment. 130 In 1976 the Employment Development Department published a report suggesting that the experiment that ran from 1971 to 1974 was unsuccessful. 131 Reagan declined to run for the governorship in 1974 and it was won by Pat Browns son Jerry . 132 Reagans governorship as professor Gary K. Clabaugh writes saw public schools deteriorate due to his opposition to additional basic education funding. 133 As for higher education journalist William Trombley believed that the budget cuts Reagan enacted damaged Berkeleys student-faculty ratio and research. 134 Additionally the homicide rate doubled and armed robbery rates rose by even more during Reagans eight years even with the many laws Reagan signed to try toughening criminal sentencing and reforming the criminal justice system. 135 Reagan strongly supported capital punishment but his efforts to enforce it were thwarted by People v. Anderson in 1972. 136 According to his son Michael Reagan said that he regretted signing the Family Law Act that granted no-fault divorces . 137 Seeking the presidency 19751981 1976 Republican primaries Main articles: Ronald Reagan 1976 presidential campaign and 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries Reagan and Gerald Ford shaking hands on the podium after Reagan narrowly lost the nomination at the 1976 Republican National Convention Insufficiently conservative to Reagan 138 and many other Republicans 139 President Gerald Ford suffered from multiple political and economic woes. Ford running for president was disappointed to hear him also run. 140 Reagan was strongly critical of detente and Fords policy of detente with the Soviet Union. 141 He repeated A Time for Choosing around the country 142 before announcing his campaign on November 20 1975 when he discussed economic and social problems and to a lesser extent foreign affairs. 143 Both candidates were determined to knock each other out early in the primaries 144 but Reagan would devastatingly lose the first five primaries beginning with New Hampshire 145 where he popularized the welfare queen narrative about Linda Taylor exaggerating her misuse of welfare benefits and igniting voter resentment for welfare reform 146 but never overtly mentioning her name or race. 147 In Florida Reagan referred to a strapping young buck 148 which became an example of dog whistle politics 149 and accused Ford for handing the Panama Canal to Panamas government while Ford implied that he would end Social Security . 145 Then in Illinois he again criticized Fords policy and his secretary of state Henry Kissinger . 150 Losing the first five primaries prompted Reagan to desperately win North Carolinas by running a grassroots campaign and uniting with the Jesse Helms political machine that viciously attacked Ford. Reagan won an upset victory convincing party delegates that Fords nomination was no longer guaranteed. 151 Reagan won subsequent victories in Texas Alabama Georgia and Indiana with his attacks on social programs opposition to forced busing increased support from inclined voters of a declining George Wallace campaign for the Democratic nomination 152 and repeated criticisms of Ford and Kissingers policies including detente . 153 The result was a seesaw battle for the 1 130 delegates required for their partys nomination that neither would reach before the Kansas City convention 154 in August 155 and Ford replacing mentions of detente with Reagans preferred phrase peace through strength . 156 Reagan took John Sears advice of choosing liberal Richard Schweiker as his running mate hoping to pry loose of delegates from Pennsylvania and other states 157 and distract Ford. Instead conservatives were left alienated and Ford picked up the remaining uncommitted delegates and prevailed earning 1 187 to Reagans 1 070. Before giving his acceptance speech Ford invited Reagan to address the convention; Reagan emphasized individual freedom 158 and the dangers of nuclear weapons. In 1977 Ford told Cannon that Reagans primary challenge contributed to his own narrow loss to Democrat Jimmy Carter in the 1976 United States presidential election . 159 1980 election Main article: Ronald Reagan 1980 presidential campaign Further information: 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries and 1980 United States presidential election 1980 presidential election Electoral College results Reagan won 48949 Reagan emerged as a vocal critic of President Carter in 1977. The Panama Canal Treaty s signing the 1979 oil crisis and rise in the interest inflation and unemployment rates helped set up his 1980 presidential campaign 160 which he announced on November 13 1979 161 with an indictment of the federal government. 162 His announcement stressed his fundamental principles of tax cuts to stimulate the economy and having both a small government and a strong national defense 163 since he believed the United States was behind the Soviet Union militarily. 164 Heading into 1980 his age became an issue among the press and the United States was in a severe recession . 165 In the primaries Reagan unexpectedly lost the Iowa caucus to George H. W. Bush . Three days before the New Hampshire primary the Reagan and Bush campaigns agreed to a one-on-one debate sponsored by The Telegraph at Nashua New Hampshire but hours before the debate the Reagan campaign invited other candidates including Bob Dole John B. Anderson Howard Baker and Phil Crane . 166 Debate moderator Jon Breen denied seats to the other candidates asserting that The Telegraph would violate federal campaign contribution laws if it sponsored the debate and changed the ground rules hours before the debate. 167 As a result the Reagan campaign agreed to pay for the debate. Reagan said that as he was funding the debate he could decide who would debate. 168 During the debate when Breen was laying out the ground rules and attempting to ask the first question Reagan interrupted in protest to make an introductory statement and wanted other candidates to be included before the debate began. 169 The moderator asked Bob Malloy the volume operator to mute Reagans microphone. After Breen repeated his demand to Malloy Reagan furiously replied I am paying for this microphone Mr. Green! sic . b 171 This turned out to be the turning point of the debate and the primary race. 172 Ultimately the four additional candidates left and the debate continued between Reagan and Bush. Reagans polling numbers improved and he won the New Hampshire primary by more than 39 000 votes. 173 Soon thereafter Reagans opponents began dropping out of the primaries including Anderson who left the party to become an independent candidate. Reagan easily captured the presidential nomination and chose Bush as his running mate at the Detroit convention in July. 174 The general election pitted Reagan against Carter amid the multitude of domestic concerns and ongoing Iran hostage crisis that began on November 4 1979. 175 Reagans campaign worried that Carter would be able to secure the release of the American hostages in Iran as part of the October surprise 176 Carter suggested that Reagan would wreck Social Security and portrayed him as a warmonger 177 and Anderson carried support from liberal Republicans dissatisfied with Reagans conservatism. 176 c One of Reagans key strengths was his appeal to the rising conservative movement. Though most conservative leaders espoused cutting taxes and budget deficits many conservatives focused more closely on social issues like abortion and gay rights . 179 Evangelical Protestants became an increasingly important voting bloc and they generally supported Reagan. 180 Reagan also won the backing of Reagan Democrats . 181 Though he advocated socially conservative view points Reagan focused much of his campaign on attacks against Carters foreign policy . 182 In August Reagan gave a speech at the Neshoba County Fair stating his belief in states rights . Joseph Crespino argues that the visit was designed to reach out to Wallace-inclined voters 183 and some also saw these actions as an extension of the Southern strategy to garner white support for Republican candidates. 184 Reagans supporters have said that this was his typical anti-big government rhetoric without racial context or intent. 185 186 187 In the October 28 debate Carter chided Reagan for being against national health insurance. Reagan replied There you go again though the audience laughed and viewers found him more appealing. 188 Reagan later asked the audience if they were better off than they were four years ago slightly paraphrasing Roosevelts words in 1934. 189 In 1983 Reagans campaign managers were revealed to having obtained Carters debate briefing book before the debates. 190 On November 4 1980 Reagan won in a decisive victory in the Electoral College over Carter carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes to Carters 49 in six states and the District of Columbia. He won the popular vote by a narrower margin receiving nearly 51 percent to Carters 41 percent and Andersons 7 percent. In the United States Congress Republicans won a majority of seats in the Senate for the first time since 1952 191 while Democrats retained the House of Representatives . 192 Presidency 19811989 Main article: Presidency of Ronald Reagan For a chronological guide see Timeline of the Ronald Reagan presidency . Further information: Domestic policy of the Ronald Reagan administration and Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration First inauguration Main article: First inauguration of Ronald Reagan Reagan delivers his inaugural address from the U.S. Capitol audio only Reagan was inaugurated as the 40th president of the United States on Tuesday January 20 1981. 193 Chief Justice Warren E. Burger administered the presidential oath of office . 194 In his inaugural address Reagan commented on the countrys economic malaise arguing In this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem . 195 As a final insult to President Carter Iran waited until Reagan had been sworn in before announcing the release of their American hostages. 196 197 Reaganomics and the economy Main article: Reaganomics Reagan advocated a laissez-faire philosophy 198 and promoted a set of neoliberal reforms dubbed Reaganomics which included monetarism and supply-side economics . 199 Taxation This section is missing information about analysis. Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page . November 2023 Reagan outlining his plan for tax cuts 1981 Reagan worked with the boll weevil Democrats to pass tax and budget legislation in a Congress led by Tip ONeill a liberal who strongly criticized Reaganomics. 200 d He lifted federal oil and gasoline price controls on January 28 1981 202 and in August he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 203 to dramatically lower federal income tax rates and require exemptions and brackets to be indexed for inflation starting in 1985. 204 Amid growing concerns about the mounting federal debt Reagan signed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 205 one of the eleven times Reagan raised taxes. 206 The bill doubled the federal cigarette tax rescinded a portion of the corporate tax cuts from the 1981 tax bill 207 and according to Paul Krugman a third of the 1981 cut overall. 208 Many of his supporters condemned the bill but Reagan defended his preservation of cuts on individual income tax rates. 209 By 1983 the amount of federal tax had fallen for all or most taxpayers but most strongly affected the wealthy. 210 The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the number of tax brackets and top tax rate and almost doubled personal exemptions . 211 To Reagan the tax cuts would not have increased the deficit as long as there was enough economic growth and spending cuts. His policies proposed that economic growth would occur when the tax cuts spur investments which would result in more spending consumption and ergo tax revenue. This theoretical relationship has been illustrated by some with the controversial Laffer curve . 212 Critics labeled this trickle-down economics the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will spread to the poor. 213 Milton Friedman and Robert Mundell argued that these policies invigorated Americas economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s . 214 Inflation and unemployment Monthly unemployment inflation and interest rates from January 1981 to January 1989 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Federal Reserve Economic Data Reagan took office in the midst of stagflation . 215 The economy briefly experienced growth before plunging into a recession in July 1981. 216 As Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker fought inflation by pursuing a tight money policy of high interest rates 217 which restricted lending and investment raised unemployment and temporarily reduced economic growth. 218 In December 1982 the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS measured the unemployment rate at 10.8 percent. 219 Around the same time economic activity began to rise until its end in 1990 setting the record for the longest peacetime expansion. 220 In 1983 the recession ended 221 and Reagan nominated Volcker to a second term in fear of damaging confidence in the economic recovery. 222 Reagan appointed Alan Greenspan to succeed Volcker in 1987. Greenspan raised interest rates in another attempt to curb inflation setting off the Black Monday stock market crash although the markets eventually recovered. 223 By 1989 the BLS measured the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent. 224 The inflation rate dropped from 12 percent during the 1980 election to under 5 percent in 1989. Likewise the interest rate dropped from 15 percent to under 10 percent. 225 Yet not all shared equally in the economic recovery and both economic inequality 226 and the number of homeless individuals increased during the 1980s. 227 Critics have contended that a majority of the jobs created during this decade paid the minimum wage. 228 Government spending In 1981 in an effort to keep it solvent Reagan approved a plan for cuts to Social Security. He later backed off of these plans due to public backlash. 229 He then created the Greenspan Commission to keep Social Security financially secure and in 1983 he signed amendments to raise both the programs payroll taxes and retirement age for benefits. 230 He had signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to cut funding for federal assistance such as food stamps unemployment benefits subsidized housing and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children 231 and would discontinue the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act . 232 On the other side defense spending doubled between 1981 and 1985. 164 During Reagans presidency Project Socrates operated within the Defense Intelligence Agency to discover why the United States was unable to maintain its economic competitiveness. According to program director Michael Sekora their findings helped the country surpass the Soviets in terms of missile defense technology. 233 234 Deregulation Reagan sought to loosen federal regulation of economic activities and he appointed key officials who shared this agenda. William Leuchtenburg writes that by 1986 the Reagan administration eliminated almost half of the federal regulations that had existed in 1981. 235 The 1982 GarnSt. Germain Depository Institutions Act deregulated savings and loan associations by letting them make a variety of loans and investments outside of real estate. 236 After the bills passage savings and loans associations engaged in riskier activities and the leaders of some institutions embezzled funds. The administrations inattentiveness toward the industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis and costly bailouts. 237 Deficits The deficits were exacerbated by the early 1980s recession which cut into federal revenue. 238 The national debt tripled between the fiscal years of 1980 and 1989 and the national debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product rose from 33 percent in 1981 to 53 percent by 1989. During his time in office Reagan never fulfilled his 1980 campaign promise of submitting a balanced budget . The United States borrowed heavily to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits. 239 Reagan described the tripled debt the greatest disappointment of his presidency . 240 Jeffrey Frankel opined that the deficits were a major reason why Reagans successor Bush reneged on his campaign promise by raising taxes through the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 . 241 Assassination attempt Main article: Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan Reagan center waves just before he is shot on March 30 1981 On March 30 1981 Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr. outside the Washington Hilton . Also struck were: James Brady Thomas Delahanty and Tim McCarthy . Although right on the margin of death upon arrival at George Washington University Hospital Reagan underwent surgery and recovered quickly from a broken rib a punctured lung and internal bleeding. Professor J. David Woodard says that the assassination attempt created a bond between him and the American people that was never really broken . 242 Later Reagan came to believe that God had spared his life for a chosen mission . 243 Supreme Court appointments Main article: Ronald Reagan Supreme Court candidates Reagan appointed three Associate Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States : Sandra Day OConnor in 1981 which fulfilled a campaign promise to name the first female justice to the Court Antonin Scalia in 1986 and Anthony Kennedy in 1988. He also elevated William Rehnquist from Associate Justice to Chief Justice in 1986. 244 The direction of the Supreme Courts reshaping has been described as conservative. 245 246 Public sector labor union fights Reagan making a statement to the press regarding the air traffic controllers strike 1981 Early in August 1981 the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization PATCO went on strike violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking. 247 On August 3 Reagan said that he would fire air traffic controllers if they did not return to work within 48 hours; according to him 38 percent did not return. On August 13 Reagan fired roughly 12 000 striking air traffic controllers who ignored his order. 248 He used military controllers 249 and supervisors to handle the nations commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained. 250 The breaking of the PATCO strike demoralized organized labor and the number of strikes fell greatly in the 1980s. 249 With the assent of Reagans sympathetic National Labor Relations Board appointees many companies also won wage and benefit cutbacks from unions especially in the manufacturing sector. 251 During Reagans presidency the share of employees who were part of a labor union dropped from approximately one-fourth of the total workforce to approximately one-sixth of the total workforce. 252 Civil rights Reagan signing the Passage of Martin Luther King Jr. Day 1983 Despite Reagan having opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 33 the bill was extended for 25 years in 1982. 253 He initially opposed the establishment of Martin Luther King Jr. Day 254 and alluded to claims that King was associated with communists during his career but signed a bill to create the holiday in 1983 after it passed both houses of Congress with veto-proof margins. 255 In 1984 he signed legislation intended to impose fines for fair housing discrimination offenses. 256 In March 1988 Reagan vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 but Congress overrode his veto. He had argued that the bill unreasonably increased the federal governments power and undermined the rights of churches and business owners. 257 Later in September legislation was passed to correct loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968 . 258 259 Early in his presidency Reagan appointed Clarence M. Pendleton Jr. known for his opposition to affirmative action and equal pay for men and women as chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights despite Pendletons hostility toward long-established civil rights views. Pendleton and Reagans subsequent appointees greatly eroded the enforcement of civil rights law arousing the ire of civil rights advocates. 260 In 1987 Reagan unsuccessfully nominated Robert Bork to the Supreme Court as a way to achieve his civil rights policy that could not be fulfilled during his presidency; his administration had opposed affirmative action particularly in education federal assistance programs housing and employment 261 but Reagan reluctantly continued these policies. 262 In housing Reagans administration saw considerably fewer fair housing cases filed than the three previous administrations. 263 War on drugs Main article: War on drugs Reagan signing the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 In response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic Reagan intensified the war on drugs in 1982. 264 While the American public did not see drugs as an important issue then the FBI Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Department of Defense all increased their anti-drug funding immensely. 265 Reagans administration publicized the campaign to gain support after crack became widespread in 1985. 266 Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and 1988 to specify penalties for drug offenses. 267 Both bills have been criticized in the years since for promoting racial disparities . 268 Additionally Nancy Reagan founded the Just Say No campaign to discourage others from engaging in recreational drug use and raise awareness about the dangers of drugs. 269 A 1988 study showed 39 percent of high school seniors using illegal drugs compared to 53 percent in 1980 270 but Scott Lilienfeld and Hal Arkowitz say that the success of these types of campaigns have not been found to be affirmatively proven. 271 Escalation of the Cold War Further information: Cold War 19791985 and Reagan Doctrine Reagan meeting with Afghan mujahideen leaders 1983 Reagan ordered a massive defense buildup; 272 he revived the B-1 Lancer program that had been rejected by the Carter administration 273 and deployed the MX missile . 274 In response to Soviet deployment of the SS-20 he oversaw NATO s deployment of the Pershing missile in Western Europe. 275 In 1982 Reagan tried to cut off the Soviet Unions access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe. It hurt the Soviet economy but it also caused much ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue; he later retreated on this issue. 276 In March 1983 Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI to protect the United States from space intercontinental ballistic missiles. He believed that this defense shield could protect the country from nuclear destruction in a hypothetical nuclear war with the Soviet Union. 277 There was much disbelief among the scientific community surrounding the programs scientific feasibility leading opponents to dub the SDI Star Wars 278 though Soviet leader Yuri Andropov said it would lead to an extremely dangerous path . 279 Reagan listening to Pakistani president Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq 1982 In a 1982 address to the British Parliament Reagan said the march of freedom and democracy... will leave MarxismLeninism on the ash heap of history . Dismissed by the American press as wishful thinking Margaret Thatcher called the address a triumph . 280 David Cannadine says of Thatcher that Reagan had been grateful for her interest in him at a time when the British establishment refused to take him seriously with the two agreeing on building up stronger defenses against Soviet Russia and both believing in outfacing what Reagan would later call the evil empire 281 in reference to the Soviet Union during a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals in March 1983. 236 After Soviet fighters downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in September which included Congressman Larry McDonald and 61 other Americans Reagan expressed outrage towards the Soviet Union. 282 The next day reports suggested that the Soviets had fired on the plane by mistake. 283 In spite of the harsh discordant rhetoric 284 Reagans administration continued discussions with the Soviet Union on START I . 285 Reagan meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Oval Office September 1983 Although the Reagan administration agreed with the communist government in China to reduce the sale of arms to Taiwan in 1982 286 Reagan himself was the first president to reject containment and detente and to put into practice the concept that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with. 287 His covert aid to Afghan mujahideen forces through Pakistan against the Soviets has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . 288 However the United States was subjected to blowback in the form of the Taliban that opposed them in the war in Afghanistan . 289 In his 1985 State of the Union Address Reagan proclaimed Support for freedom fighters is self-defense . 290 Through the Reagan Doctrine his administration supported anti-communist movements that fought against groups backed by the Soviet Union in an effort to rollback Soviet-backed communist governments and reduce Soviet influence across the world. 291 Critics have felt that the administration ignored the human rights violations in the countries they backed 292 including genocide in Guatemala 293 and mass killings in Chad. 294 Invasion of Grenada Main article: United States invasion of Grenada Reagan discussing the Grenada situation with a bipartisan group of members of Congress 1983 On October 19 1983 Maurice Bishop was overthrown and murdered by one of his colleagues. Several days later Reagan ordered American forces to invade Grenada. Reagan cited a regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean nation and concern for the safety of hundreds of American medical students at St. Georges University as adequate reasons to invade. Two days of fighting commenced resulting in an American victory. 295 While the invasion enjoyed public support in the United States it was criticized internationally with the United Nations General Assembly voting to censure the American government. 296 Cannon later noted that throughout Reagans 1984 presidential campaign the invasion overshadowed the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings 297 which killed 241 Americans taking part in an international peacekeeping operation during the Lebanese Civil War . 298 1984 election Main articles: Ronald Reagan 1984 presidential campaign and 1984 United States presidential election 1984 presidential election Electoral College results Reagan won 52513 Reagan announced his reelection campaign on January 29 1984 declaring America is back and standing tall . 231 In February his administration reversed the unpopular decision to send the United States Marine Corps to Lebanon thus eliminating a political liability for him. Reagan faced minimal opposition in the Republican primaries 299 and he and Bush accepted the nomination at the Dallas convention in August. 300 In the general election his campaign ran the commercial Morning in America . 301 At a time when the American economy was already recovering 221 former vice president Walter Mondale 302 was attacked by Reagans campaign as a tax-and-spend Democrat while Mondale criticized the deficit the SDI and Reagans civil rights policy. However Reagans age induced his campaign managers to minimize his public appearances. Mondales campaign believed that Reagans age and mental health were issues before the October presidential debates . 303 Following Reagans performance in the first debate where he struggled to recall statistics his age was brought up by the media in negative fashion. Reagans campaign changed his tactics for the second debate where he quipped I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience . This remark generated applause and laughter 304 even from Mondale. At that point Broder suggested that age was no longer a liability for Reagan 305 and Mondales campaign felt that the election was over . 306 In November Reagan won a landslide reelection victory with 59 percent of the popular vote and 525 electoral votes from 49 states. Mondale won 41 percent of the popular vote and 13 electoral votes from the District of Columbia and his home state of Minnesota. 307 Response to the AIDS epidemic Main article: Ronald Reagan and AIDS Reagan has been criticized for his delayed and muted response to the AIDS epidemic. This 1987 art installation by ACT UP quotes Reagan on AIDS with a blank slate representing total silence. The AIDS epidemic began to unfold in 1981 308 and AIDS was initially difficult to understand for physicians and the public. 309 As the epidemic advanced according to White House physician and later physician to the president brigadier general John Hutton Reagan thought of AIDS as though it was the measles and would go away . The October 1985 death of the Presidents friend Rock Hudson affected Reagans view; Reagan approached Hutton for more information on the disease. Still between September 18 1985 and February 4 1986 Reagan did not mention AIDS in public. 310 In 1986 Reagan asked C. Everett Koop to draw up a report on the AIDS issue. Koop angered many evangelical conservatives both in and out of the Reagan administration by stressing the importance of sex education including condom usage in schools. 311 A year later Reagan who reportedly had not read the report 312 gave his first speech on the epidemic when 36 058 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS and 20 849 had died of it. 313 Reagan called for increased testing including routine testing for marriage applicants and mandatory testing of select groups including federal prisoners. 314 Even after this speech however Reagan remained reluctant to publicly address AIDS. 315 Scholars and AIDS activists have argued that the Reagan administration largely ignored the AIDS crisis . 316 317 318 Randy Shilts and Michael Bronski said that AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagans administration and Bronski added that requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were routinely denied. 319 320 In a September 1985 press conference soon after Hollywood celebrity Rock Hudson had announced his AIDS diagnosis Reagan called a government AIDS research program a top priority but also cited budgetary constraints. 321 Between the fiscal years of 1984 and 1989 federal spending on AIDS totaled 5.6 billion. The Reagan administration proposed 2.8 billion during this time period but pressure from congressional Democrats resulted in the larger amount. 322 Addressing apartheid Shortly after the 1984 election Reagan met Desmond Tutu who described Reagans administration as an unmitigated disaster for us blacks 323 and Reagan himself as a racist pure and simple . 324 Popular opposition to apartheid increased during Reagans first term in office and the disinvestment from South Africa movement achieved critical mass after decades of growing momentum. Criticism of apartheid was particularly strong on college campuses and among mainline Protestant denominations. 325 326 President Reagan was opposed to divestiture because he personally thought as he wrote in a letter to Sammy Davis Jr. it would hurt the very people we are trying to help and would leave us no contact within South Africa to try and bring influence to bear on the government . He also noted the fact that the American-owned industries there employ more than 80 000 blacks and that their employment practices were very different from the normal South African customs . 327 The Reagan administration developed constructive engagement 328 with the South African government as a means of encouraging it to gradually move away from apartheid and to give up its nuclear weapons program . 329 It was part of a larger initiative designed to foster peaceful economic development and political change throughout southern Africa. 330 This policy however engendered much public criticism and renewed calls for the imposition of stringent sanctions. 331 In response Reagan announced the imposition of new sanctions on the South African government including an arms embargo in late 1985. 332 These sanctions were seen as weak by anti-apartheid activists and as insufficient by the presidents opponents in Congress. 331 In 1986 Congress approved the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act which included tougher sanctions; Reagans veto was overridden by Congress. Afterward he remained opposed to apartheid and unsure of how best to oppose it . Several European countries as well as Japan also imposed their sanctions on South Africa soon after. 333 Libya bombing Main article: 1986 United States bombing of Libya Reagan receiving a briefing on the Libya bombing 1986 Contentious relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were revived in the West Berlin discotheque bombing that killed an American soldier and injured dozens of others on April 5 1986. Stating that there was irrefutable evidence that Libya had a direct role in the bombing Reagan authorized the use of force against the country. On April 14 the United States launched a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya. 334 Thatcher allowed the United States Air Force to use Britains air bases to launch the attack on the justification that the United Kingdom was supporting Americas right to self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations . 335 The attack was according to Reagan designed to halt Muammar Gaddafi s ability to export terrorism offering him incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior . 336 The attack was condemned by many countries; by an overwhelming vote the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to condemn the attack and deem it a violation of the Charter and international law. 337 IranContra affair Main article: IranContra affair Reagan receiving the Tower Commission on the IranContra affair 1987 Reagan authorized William J. Casey to arm the Contras fearing that Communists would take over Nicaragua if it remained under the leadership of the Sandinistas . Congress passed the 1982 Boland Amendment prohibiting the CIA and United States Department of Defense from using their budgets to provide aid to the Contras. Still the Reagan administration raised funds for the Contras from private donors and foreign governments. 338 When Congress learned that the CIA had secretly placed naval mines in Nicaraguan harbors Congress passed a second Boland Amendment that barred granting any assistance to the Contras. 339 By mid-1985 Hezbollah began to take American hostages in Lebanon holding seven of them in reaction to the United States support of Israel. 340 Reagan procured the release of seven American hostages held by Hezbollah by selling American arms to Iran then engaged in the IranIraq War in hopes that Iran would pressure Hezbollah to release the hostages. 341 The Reagan administration sold over 2 000 missiles to Iran without informing Congress; Hezbollah released four hostages but captured an additional six Americans. On Oliver North s initiative the administration redirected the proceeds from the missile sales to the Contras. 341 The transactions were exposed by Ash-Shiraa in early November 1986. Reagan initially denied any wrongdoing but on November 25 he announced that John Poindexter and North had left the administration and that he would form the Tower Commission to investigate the transactions. A few weeks later Reagan asked a panel of federal judges to appoint a special prosecutor who would conduct a separate investigation. 342 The Tower Commission released a report in February 1987 confirming that the administration had traded arms for hostages and sent the proceeds of the weapons sales to the Contras. The report laid most of the blame on North Poindexter and Robert McFarlane but it was also critical of Donald Regan and other White House staffers. 343 Investigators did not find conclusive proof that Reagan had known about the aid provided to the Contras but the report noted that Reagan had created the conditions which made possible the crimes committed by others and had knowingly participated or acquiesced in covering up the scandal . 344 The affair damaged the administration and raised questions about Reagans competency and the wisdom of conservative policies. 345 The administrations credibility was also badly damaged on the international stage as it had violated its own arms embargo on Iran. 346 The USS Stark incident In the context of the Tanker War on May 17 1987 an Iraqi fighter jet hit the USS Stark with two Exocet missiles killing 37 sailors. 347 348 Three days later President Reagan declared a policy of self-defense would now be ordered as he accepted Iraqs official apology: 349 Our ships are deployed in the Persian Gulf in order to protect U.S. interests and maintain free access and maintain freedom of navigation and access to the areas oil supplies. It is a vital mission but our ships need to protect themselves and they will. From now on if aircraft approach any of our ships in a way that appears hostile there is one order of battle. Defend yourselves. Defend American lives.. Were going to do what has to be done to keep the Persian Gulf open. Its international waters. No country there has a right to try and close it off and take it for itself. And the villain in the piece really is Iran. And so theyre delighted with what has just happened. 350 Soviet decline and thaw in relations Further information: Cold War 19851991 Mikhail Gorbachev and Reagan signing the INF Treaty 1987 Although the Soviets did not accelerate military spending in response to Reagans military buildup 351 their enormous military expenses in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy . At the same time the prices of oil the primary source of Soviet export revenues fell to one third of the previous level in 1985. These factors contributed to a stagnant economy during the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev as Soviet leader. 352 President Ronald Reagan giving a speech at Moscow State University in the USSR 1988 Reagans foreign policy towards the Soviets wavered between brinkmanship and cooperation. 353 Reagan appreciated Gorbachevs revolutionary change in the direction of the Soviet policy and shifted to diplomacy intending to encourage him to pursue substantial arms agreements. 287 They held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988 . 354 Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech this would lead to reform and the end of communism. 355 The critical summit was in Reykjavik in 1986 where they agreed to abolish all nuclear weapons. However Gorbachev added the condition that SDI research must be confined to laboratories during the ten-year period when disarmament would take place. Reagan refused stating that it was defensive only and that he would share the secrets with the Soviets thus failing to reach a deal. 356 In June 1987 Reagan addressed Gorbachev during a speech at the Berlin Wall demanding that he tear down this wall . The remark was ignored at the time but after the wall fell in November 1989 it was retroactively recast as a soaring achievement. 357 358 359 In December Reagan and Gorbachev met again at the Washington Summit 360 to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty committing to the total abolition of their respective short-range and medium-range missile stockpiles. 361 The treaty established an inspections regime designed to ensure that both parties honored the agreement. 362 In May 1988 the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly voted in favor of ratifying the treaty 363 providing a major boost to Reagans popularity in the aftermath of the IranContra affair. A new era of trade and openness between the two powers commenced and the United States and Soviet Union cooperated on international issues such as the IranIraq War. 364 Post-presidency 19892004 Reagan and Gorbachev at Rancho del Cielo 1992 Nancy and Ronald Reagan with a model of USS Ronald Reagan 1996 Upon leaving the presidency on January 20 1989 at the age of 77 Reagan became the oldest president at the end of his tenure surpassing Dwight D. Eisenhower who left office on January 20 1961 at the age of 70. This distinction will eventually pass to incumbent president Joe Biden who is currently 81 years old. 365 366 In retirement Ronald and Nancy Reagan lived at 668 St. Cloud Road in Bel Air in addition to Rancho del Cielo in Santa Barbara . 367 He received multiple awards and honors 368 in addition to generous payments for speaking engagements. In 1989 he supported repealing the Twenty-second Amendment s presidential term limits. In 1991 the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library opened. Reagan also addressed the 1992 Republican National Convention to inspire allegiance to the party regulars ; 369 and favored a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. Support for Brady Bill Reagan publicly favored the Brady Bill drawing criticism from gun control opponents. 370 In 1989 in his first public appearance after leaving office and shortly after the Stockton schoolyard shooting at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton California he stated: I do not believe in taking away the right of the citizen to own guns for sporting for hunting and so forth or for home defense. But I do believe that an AK-47 a machine gun is not a sporting weapon or needed for the defense of the home . 371 372 In March 1991 Reagan wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled Why Im for the Brady Bill . 373 374 In May 1994 Reagan Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter sent a letter to House members urging them to support the controversial Federal Assault Weapons Ban . 375 Alzheimers disease His final public speech occurred on February 3 1994 during a tribute to him in Washington D.C.; his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27 1994. 369 In August 1994 Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease which he announced through a handwritten letter in November. 376 There was speculation over how long he had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration 377 but lay observations that he suffered from Alzheimers while still in office have been disputed by medical experts; 378 379 380 his doctors said that he first began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 381 or 1993. 380 Over time the disease destroyed Reagans mental capacity. By 1997 he was reported to recognize few people other than his wife though he continued to walk through parks and on beaches play golf and visit his office in nearby Century City . 380 Eventually his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife. 382 By the end of 2003 Reagan had lost his ability to speak and was mostly confined to his bed no longer able to recognize any family members. 383 Death and funeral Main article: Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan Reagan died of pneumonia complicated by Alzheimers 384 at his home in Los Angeles on June 5 2004. 385 President George W. Bush called Reagans death a sad hour in the life of America . 384 His public funeral was held in the Washington National Cathedral 386 where eulogies were given by Margaret Thatcher Brian Mulroney George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. 387 Other world leaders attended including Mikhail Gorbachev and Lech Waesa . 388 Reagan was interred at his presidential library. 387 Legacy See also: List of things named after Ronald Reagan and Cultural depictions of Ronald Reagan Historical reputation The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley California In 2008 British historian M. J. Heale summarized that scholars had reached a broad consensus in which Reagan rehabilitated conservatism turned the country to the right practiced a pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology with the constraints of government revived faith in the presidency and American self-respect and contributed to critically ending the Cold War 389 which ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. 390 Many conservative and liberal scholars have agreed that Reagan has been the most influential president since Roosevelt leaving his imprint on American politics diplomacy culture and economics through his effective communication of his conservative agenda and pragmatic compromising. 391 During the initial years of Reagans post-presidency historical rankings placed his presidency in the twenties. 392 Throughout the 2000s and 2010s his presidency was often placed in the top ten. 393 394 Many proponents including his Cold War contemporaries 395 396 believe that his defense policies economic policies military policies and hard-line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and communism together with his summits with Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War. 397 287 Professor Jeffrey Knopf argues that while Reagans practice of referring to the Soviet Union as evil probably made no difference to the Soviet leaders it possibly gave encouragement to Eastern European citizens who opposed their communist regimes. 287 President Trumans policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the Soviet Union and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself. 398 Nevertheless Melvyn P. Leffler called Reagan Gorbachevs minor yet indispensable partner setting the framework for the dramatic changes that neither anticipated happening anytime soon . 399 Critics for example Paul Krugman note Reagans tenure as having begun a period of increased income inequality sometimes called the Great Divergence . Krugman also views Reagan as having initiated the ideology of the current-day Republican Party which he feels is led by radicals who seek to undo the twentieth century gains in income equality and unionization. 400 Others such as Nixons Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson also criticize what they feel was not just Reagans fiscal irresponsibility but also the ushering in of an era where tax cutting became the GOPs core platform with resulting deficits and GOP leaders speciously in Petersons opinion arguing supply-side gains would enable the country to grow its way out of deficits. 401 Reagan was known for storytelling and humor 402 which involved puns 403 and self-deprecation. 404 Reagan also often emphasized family values despite being the first president to have been divorced. 405 He showed the ability to comfort Americans during the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster . 406 Reagans ability to talk about substantive issues with understandable terms and to focus on mainstream American concerns earned him the laudatory moniker the Great Communicator . 407 402 He also earned the nickname Teflon President in that public perceptions of him were not substantially tarnished by the multitude of controversies that arose during his administration . 408 409 Political influence Reagan led a new conservative movement altering the political dynamic of the United States. 410 Conservatism became the dominant ideology for Republicans displacing the partys faction of liberals and moderates. 411 In his time men began voting more Republican and women began voting more Democrat a gender distinction that has persisted. 410 He was supported by young voters an allegiance that shifted many of them to the party. 412 He attempted to appeal to black voters in 1980 413 but would receive the lowest black vote for a Republican presidential candidate at the time. 414 Throughout Reagans presidency Republicans were unable to gain complete control of Congress. 415 The period of American history most dominated by Reagan and his policies particularly on taxes welfare defense the federal judiciary and the Cold War is known as the Reagan era which suggests that the Reagan Revolution had a lasting impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations are often treated as an extension of the era as is the George W. Bush administration . 416 Since 1988 Republican presidential candidates have invoked Reagans policies and beliefs . 417 Notes Pronounced r e n i RAY -gn 7 Reagan misstated Breens last name as Mr. Green 170 John B. Anderson questioned how realistic Reagans budget proposals were saying: The only way Reagan is going to cut taxes increase defense spending and balance the budget at the same time is to use blue smoke and mirrors. 178 Despite their various disagreements Reagan and ONeill developed a friendship across party lines. ONeill told Reagan that Republican opponents were friends after six oclock . Reagan would sometimes call ONeill at any time and ask if it was after six oclock to which ONeill would invariably respond Absolutely Mr. President . 201 References Citations Holmes 2020 p. 210.
