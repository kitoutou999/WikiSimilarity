She had been queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during her lifetime and was the monarch of 15 realms at her death. Her reign of 70 years and 214 days is the longest of any British monarch and the second-longest of any sovereign state . Elizabeth was born in Mayfair London during the reign of her paternal grandfather King George V . She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother . Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother Edward VIII making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive . She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service . In November 1947 she married Philip Mountbatten a former prince of Greece and Denmark . Their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021 . They had four children: Charles Anne Andrew and Edward . When her father died in February 1952 Elizabeth then 25 years old became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom Canada Australia New Zealand South Africa Pakistan and Ceylon known today as Sri Lanka as well as head of the Commonwealth . Elizabeth reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland devolution in the United Kingdom the decolonisation of Africa and the United Kingdoms accession to the European Communities as well as its subsequent withdrawal . The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics . As queen Elizabeth was served by more than 170 prime ministers across her realms. Her many historic visits and meetings included state visits to China in 1986 to Russia in 1994 and to the Republic of Ireland in 2011 and meetings with five popes and fourteen US presidents. Significant events included her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver Golden Diamond and Platinum jubilees . Although there was occasional republican sentiment and media criticism of her familyparticularly after the breakdowns of her childrens marriages her annus horribilis in 1992 and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana support for the monarchy and her personal popularity in the United Kingdom remained consistently high. Elizabeth died aged 96 at Balmoral Castle and was succeeded by her eldest son Charles III. Early life Elizabeth was born on 21 April 1926 the first child of Prince Albert Duke of York later King George VI and his wife Elizabeth Duchess of York later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary and her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne . She was delivered at 02:40 GMT 1 by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfathers London home 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair . 2 The Anglican Archbishop of York Cosmo Gordon Lang baptised her in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May 3 b and she was named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal great-grandmother who had died six months earlier ; and Mary after her paternal grandmother. 5 She was called Lilibet by her close family 6 based on what she called herself at first. 7 She was cherished by her grandfather George V whom she affectionately called Grandpa England 8 and her regular visits during his serious illness in 1929 were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery. 9 On the cover of Time April 1929 Portrait by Philip de Laszlo 1933 Elizabeths only sibling Princess Margaret was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess Marion Crawford . 10 Lessons concentrated on history language literature and music. 11 Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margarets childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950 much to the dismay of the royal family . 12 The book describes Elizabeths love of horses and dogs her orderliness and her attitude of responsibility. 13 Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant. 14 Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as a jolly little girl but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved . 15 Elizabeths early life was spent primarily at the Yorks residences at 145 Piccadilly their town house in London and Royal Lodge in Windsor. 16 Heir presumptive During her grandfathers reign Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the British throne behind her uncle Edward Prince of Wales and her father. Although her birth generated public interest she was not expected to become queen as Edward was still young and likely to marry and have children of his own who would precede Elizabeth in the line of succession. 17 When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII she became second in line to the throne after her father. Later that year Edward abdicated after his proposed marriage to divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis . 18 Consequently Elizabeths father became king taking the regnal name George VI. Since Elizabeth had no brothers she became heir presumptive . If her parents had subsequently had a son he would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession which was determined by the male-preference primogeniture in effect at the time. 19 Elizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten Vice-Provost of Eton College 20 and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses. 21 A Girl Guides company the 1st Buckingham Palace Company was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her age. 22 Later she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger . 21 In 1939 Elizabeths parents toured Canada and the United States. As in 1927 when they had toured Australia and New Zealand Elizabeth remained in Britain since her father thought she was too young to undertake public tours. 23 She looked tearful as her parents departed. 24 They corresponded regularly 24 and she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call on 18 May. 23 Second World War In Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform April 1945 In September 1939 Britain entered the Second World War . Lord Hailsham suggested that Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret should be evacuated to Canada to avoid the frequent aerial bombings of London by the Luftwaffe . 25 This was rejected by their mother who declared The children wont go without me. I wont leave without the King. And the King will never leave. 26 The princesses stayed at Balmoral Castle Scotland until Christmas 1939 when they moved to Sandringham House Norfolk. 27 From February to May 1940 they lived at Royal Lodge Windsor until moving to Windsor Castle where they lived for most of the next five years. 28 At Windsor the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queens Wool Fund which bought yarn to knit into military garments. 29 In 1940 the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC s Childrens Hour addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. 30 She stated: We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors soldiers and airmen and we are trying too to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war. We know every one of us that in the end all will be well. 30 In 1943 Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year. 31 As she approached her 18th birthday Parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five counsellors of state in the event of her fathers incapacity or absence abroad such as his visit to Italy in July 1944. 32 In February 1945 she was appointed an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number 230873. 33 She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander female equivalent of captain at the time five months later. 34 Elizabeth far left on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill 8 May 1945 At the end of the war in Europe on Victory in Europe Day Elizabeth and Margaret mingled incognito with the celebrating crowds in the streets of London. In 1985 Elizabeth recalled in a rare interview ... we asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised ... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief. 35 36 During the war plans were drawn to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru the Welsh League of Youth were abandoned for several reasons including fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war. 37 Welsh politicians suggested she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary Herbert Morrison supported the idea but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. 38 In 1946 she was inducted into the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales . 39 Elizabeth went on her first overseas tour in 1947 accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday she made the following pledge: 40 c I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong. But I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with me as I now invite you to do: I know that your support will be unfailingly given. God help me to make good my vow and God bless all of you who are willing to share in it. Marriage Main article: Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten Elizabeth met her future husband Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark in 1934 and again in 1937. 42 They were second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria . After meeting for the third time at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939 Elizabeththough only 13 years oldsaid she fell in love with Philip who was 18 and they began to exchange letters. 43 She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947. 44 The engagement attracted some controversy. Philip had no financial standing was foreign-born though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links. 45 Marion Crawford wrote Some of the Kings advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philips foreign origin. 46 Later biographies reported that Elizabeths mother had reservations about the union initially and teased Philip as the Hun . 47 In later life however she told the biographer Tim Heald that Philip was an English gentleman . 48 At Buckingham Palace with Philip after their wedding 1947 Before the marriage Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten taking the surname of his mothers British family . 49 Shortly before the wedding he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style His Royal Highness . 50 Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey . They received 2 500 wedding gifts from around the world. 51 Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown which was designed by Norman Hartnell because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war. 52 In post-war Britain it was not acceptable for Philips German relations including his three surviving sisters to be invited to the wedding. 53 Neither was an invitation extended to the Duke of Windsor formerly King Edward VIII. 54 Elizabeth gave birth to her first child Prince Charles in November 1948. One month earlier the King had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince. 55 A second child Princess Anne was born in August 1950. 56 Following their wedding the couple leased Windlesham Moor near Windsor Castle until July 1949 51 when they took up residence at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951 Philip was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardamanga at Villa Guardamangia the rented home of Philips uncle Lord Mountbatten . Their two children remained in Britain. 57 Reign Accession and coronation Main article: Coronation of Elizabeth II Coronation portrait by Cecil Beaton 1953 As George VIs health declined during 1951 Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she visited Canada and Harry S. Truman in Washington DC in October 1951 her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour. 58 In early 1952 Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of the British colony of Kenya . On 6 February they had just returned to their Kenyan home Sagana Lodge after a night spent at Treetops Hotel when word arrived of the death of Elizabeths father. Philip broke the news to the new queen. 59 She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name 60 and was therefore called Elizabeth II. The numeral offended some Scots as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland. 61 She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom. 62 Elizabeth and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace. 63 With Elizabeths accession it seemed possible that the royal house would take her husbands name in line with the custom for married women of the time. Lord Mountbatten advocated for House of Mountbatten and Philip suggested House of Edinburgh after his ducal title. 64 The British prime minister Winston Churchill and Elizabeths grandmother Queen Mary favoured the retention of the House of Windsor . Elizabeth issued a declaration on 9 April 1952 that the royal house would continue to be Windsor . Philip complained I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children. 65 In 1960 the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeths male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles. 66 67 Amid preparations for the coronation Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry Peter Townsend a divorce 16 years Margarets senior with two sons from his previous marriage. Elizabeth asked them to wait for a year; in the words of her private secretary the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess but I think she thoughtshe hopedgiven time the affair would peter out. 68 Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession . 69 Margaret decided to abandon her plans with Townsend. 70 In 1960 she married Antony Armstrong-Jones who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; Margaret did not remarry. 71 Despite Queen Marys death on 24 March 1953 the coronation went ahead as planned on 2 June as Mary had requested. 72 The coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey was televised for the first time with the exception of the anointing and communion . 73 d On Elizabeths instruction her coronation gown was embroidered with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries. 77 Early reign Further information: Commonwealth realm From the accession of Elizabeth II Elizabeths realms and their territories and protectorates at the beginning of her reign in 1952: United Kingdom Colonies protectorates and mandates Dominionsrealms From Elizabeths birth onwards the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations . 78 By the time of her accession in 1952 her role as head of multiple independent states was already established. 79 In 1953 Elizabeth and Philip embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40 000 miles 64 000 km by land sea and air. 80 She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations. 81 During the tour crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her. 82 Throughout her reign she made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth ; she was the most widely travelled head of state . 83 In 1956 the British and French prime ministers Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome which established the European Economic Community the precursor to the European Union . 84 In November 1956 Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal . Lord Mountbatten said that Elizabeth was opposed to the invasion though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later. 85 With Commonwealth leaders at the 1960 Commonwealth Conference The governing Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for choosing a leader meaning that it fell to Elizabeth to decide whom to commission to form a government following Edens resignation. Eden recommended she consult Lord Salisbury the lord president of the council . Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir the lord chancellor consulted the British Cabinet Churchill and the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee resulting in Elizabeth appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan . 86 The Suez crisis and the choice of Edens successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of Elizabeth. In a magazine which he owned and edited 87 Lord Altrincham accused her of being out of touch . 88 Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments. 89 Six years later in 1963 Macmillan resigned and advised Elizabeth to appoint Alec Douglas-Home as the prime minister advice she followed. 90 Elizabeth again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister. 90 In 1965 the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader thus relieving the Queen of her involvement. 91 With Philip seated on thrones at the Canadian parliament 1957 In 1957 Elizabeth made a state visit to the United States where she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour she opened the 23rd Canadian Parliament becoming the first monarch of Canada to open a parliamentary session. 92 Two years later solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada she revisited the United States and toured Canada. 92 93 In 1961 she toured Cyprus India Pakistan Nepal and Iran . 94 On a visit to Ghana the same year she dismissed fears for her safety even though her host President Kwame Nkrumah who had replaced her as head of state was a target for assassins. 95 Harold Macmillan wrote The Queen has been absolutely determined all through ... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as ... a film star ... She has indeed the heart and stomach of a man ... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen. 95 Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964 the press reported that extremists within the Quebec separatist movement were plotting Elizabeths assassination. 96 No assassination attempt was made but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal ; her calmness and courage in the face of the violence was noted. 97 Elizabeth gave birth to her third child Prince Andrew in February 1960; this was the first birth to a reigning British monarch since 1857. 98 Her fourth child Prince Edward was born in March 1964. 99 Political reforms and crises In Queensland Australia 1970 With President Tito of Yugoslavia in Belgrade 1972 The 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. More than 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965 however the Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith in opposition to moves towards majority rule unilaterally declared independence while expressing loyalty and devotion to Elizabeth. Although Elizabeth formally dismissed him and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia his regime survived for over a decade. 100 As Britains ties to its former empire weakened the British government sought entry to the European Community a goal it achieved in 1973 . 101 In 1966 the Queen was criticised for waiting eight days before visiting the village of Aberfan where a mining disaster killed 116 children and 28 adults. Martin Charteris said that the delay made on his advice was a mistake that she later regretted. 102 103 Elizabeth toured Yugoslavia in October 1972 becoming the first British monarch to visit a communist country . 104 She was received at the airport by President Josip Broz Tito and a crowd of thousands greeted her in Belgrade . 105 In February 1974 British prime minister Edward Heath advised Elizabeth to call a general election in the middle of her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim requiring her to fly back to Britain. 106 The election resulted in a hung parliament ; Heaths Conservatives were not the largest party but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals . When discussions on forming a coalition foundered Heath resigned and Elizabeth asked the Leader of the Opposition Labour s Harold Wilson to form a government. 107 A year later at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis the Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlams budget proposals. 108 As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to Elizabeth to reverse Kerrs decision. She declined saying she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general . 109 The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism . 108 Leaders of the G7 states members of the royal family and Elizabeth centre London 1977 In 1977 Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours . The celebrations re-affirmed Elizabeths popularity despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margarets separation from her husband Lord Snowdon. 110 In 1978 Elizabeth endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania s communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena 111 though privately she thought they had blood on their hands . 112 The following year brought two blows: the unmasking of Anthony Blunt former Surveyor of the Queens Pictures as a communist spy and the assassination of Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army . 113 According to Paul Martin Sr. by the end of the 1970s Elizabeth was worried the Crown had little meaning for Pierre Trudeau the Canadian prime minister. 114 Tony Benn said Elizabeth found Trudeau rather disappointing . 114 Trudeaus supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind Elizabeths back in 1977 and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office. 114 In 1980 Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found Elizabeth better informed ... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats . 114 She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60 which would have affected her role as head of state. 114 Perils and dissent Riding Burmese at the 1986 Trooping the Colour ceremony During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony six weeks before the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer six shots were fired at Elizabeth from close range as she rode down The Mall London on her horse Burmese . Police later discovered the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant Marcus Sarjeant was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three. 115 Elizabeths composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised. 116 That October Elizabeth was the subject of another attack while on a visit to Dunedin New Zealand. Christopher John Lewis who was 17 years old fired a shot with a .22 rifle from the fifth floor of a building overlooking the parade but missed. 117 Lewis was arrested but instead of being charged with attempted murder or treason was sentenced to three years in jail for unlawful possession and discharge of a firearm. Two years into his sentence he attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital with the intention of assassinating Charles who was visiting the country with Diana and their son Prince William . 118 Riding at Windsor with President Reagan June 1982 From April to September 1982 Elizabeths son Andrew served with British forces in the Falklands War for which she reportedly felt anxiety 119 and pride. 120 On 9 July she awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder Michael Fagan in the room with her. In a serious lapse of security assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard. 121 After hosting US president Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983 Elizabeth was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada one of her Caribbean realms without informing her. 122 Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press pioneered by The Sun tabloid. 123 As Kelvin MacKenzie editor of The Sun told his staff: Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Dont worry if its not trueso long as theres not too much of a fuss about it afterwards. 124 Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers dont check their facts or accept denials: they dont care if the stories are true or not. It was reported most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986 that Elizabeth was worried that Margaret Thatcher s economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment a series of riots the violence of a miners strike and Thatchers refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth secretary-general Shridath Ramphal but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. 125 Thatcher reputedly said Elizabeth would vote for the Social Democratic Party Thatchers political opponents. 126 Thatchers biographer John Campbell claimed the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making . 127 Reports of acrimony between them were exaggerated 128 and Elizabeth gave two honours in her personal giftmembership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major . 129 Brian Mulroney Canadian prime minister between 1984 and 1993 said Elizabeth was a behind the scenes force in ending apartheid. 130 131 In 1986 Elizabeth paid a six-day state visit to the Peoples Republic of China becoming the first British monarch to visit the country. 132 The tour included the Forbidden City the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Warriors . 133 At a state banquet Elizabeth joked about the first British emissary to China being lost at sea with Queen Elizabeth I s letter to the Wanli Emperor and remarked fortunately postal services have improved since 1602 . 134 Elizabeths visit also signified the acceptance of both countries that sovereignty over Hong Kong would be transferred from the United Kingdom to China in 1997. 135 By the end of the 1980s Elizabeth had become the target of satire. 136 The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show Its a Royal Knockout in 1987 was ridiculed. 137 In Canada Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes including Pierre Trudeau. 130 The same year the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup . As monarch of Fiji Elizabeth supported the attempts of Governor-General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic. 138 Turbulent years In the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War Elizabeth became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress in May 1991. 139 With Philip in Germany October 1992 In November 1992 in a speech to mark the Ruby Jubilee of her accession Elizabeth called 1992 her annus horribilis a Latin phrase meaning horrible year . 140 Republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of Elizabeths private wealthcontradicted by the Palace e and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family. 145 In March her second son Prince Andrew separated from his wife Sarah ; her daughter Princess Anne divorced Captain Mark Phillips in April; 146 angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at Elizabeth during a state visit to Germany in October; 147 and a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle one of her official residences in November. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny. 148 In an unusually personal speech Elizabeth said that any institution must expect criticism but suggested it might be done with a touch of humour gentleness and understanding . 149 Two days later John Major announced plans to reform the royal finances drawn up the previous year including Elizabeth paying income tax from 1993 onwards and a reduction in the civil list . 150 In December Prince Charles and his wife Diana formally separated. 151 At the end of the year Elizabeth sued The Sun newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated 200 000 to charity. 152 Elizabeths solicitors had taken successful action against The Sun five years earlier for breach of copyright after it published a photograph of her daughter-in-law the Duchess of York and her granddaughter Princess Beatrice . 153 In January 1994 Elizabeth broke the scaphoid bone in her left wrist as the horse she was riding at Sandringham tripped and fell. 154 In October 1994 she became the first reigning British monarch to set foot on Russian soil. f In October 1995 she was tricked into a hoax call by Montreal radio host Pierre Brassard impersonating Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien . Elizabeth who believed that she was speaking to Chretien said she supported Canadian unity and would try to influence Quebecs referendum on proposals to break away from Canada. 159 In the year that followed public revelations on the state of Charles and Dianas marriage continued. 160 In consultation with her husband and John Major as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and her private secretary Robert Fellowes Elizabeth wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995 suggesting that a divorce would be advisable. 161 In August 1997 a year after the divorce Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. Elizabeth was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Dianas two sons Princes William and Harry wanted to attend church so Elizabeth and Philip took them that morning. 162 Afterwards for five days the royal couple shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private 163 but the royal familys silence and seclusion and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay. 131 164 Pressured by the hostile reaction Elizabeth agreed to return to London and address the nation in a live television broadcast on 5 September the day before Dianas funeral . 165 In the broadcast she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings as a grandmother for the two princes. 166 As a result much of the public hostility evaporated. 166 In October 1997 Elizabeth and Philip made a state visit to India which included a controversial visit to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to pay her respects. Protesters chanted Killer Queen go back 167 and there were demands for her to apologise for the action of British troops 78 years earlier. 168 At the memorial in the park she and Philip laid a wreath and stood for a 30second moment of silence . 168 As a result much of the fury among the public softened and the protests were called off. 167 That November the royal couple held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their golden wedding anniversary. 169 Elizabeth made a speech and praised Philip for his role as consort referring to him as my strength and stay . 169 In 1999 as part of the process of devolution in the United Kingdom Elizabeth formally opened newly established legislatures for Wales and Scotland: the National Assembly for Wales at Cardiff in May 170 and the Scottish Parliament at Edinburgh in July. 171 Dawn of the new millennium Golden Jubilee dinner with living British prime ministers 2002: left to right Tony Blair Margaret Thatcher Edward Heath Elizabeth James Callaghan John Major On the eve of the new millennium Elizabeth and Philip boarded a vessel from Southwark bound for the Millennium Dome .

Her sister and mother died in February and March respectively and the media speculated on whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure. 177 Princess Margarets death shook Elizabeth; her funeral was one of the rare occasions where Elizabeth openly cried. 178 Elizabeth again undertook an extensive tour of her realms beginning in Jamaica in February where she called the farewell banquet memorable after a power cut plunged Kings House the official residence of the governor-general into darkness. 179 As in 1977 there were street parties and commemorative events and monuments were named to honour the occasion. One million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London 180 and the enthusiasm shown for Elizabeth by the public was greater than many journalists had anticipated. 181 Greeting NASA employees at the Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland May 2007 In 2003 Elizabeth sued the Daily Mirror for breach of confidence and obtained an injunction which prevented the outlet from publishing information gathered by a reporter who posed as a footman at Buckingham Palace. 182 The newspaper also paid 25 000 towards her legal costs. 183 Though generally healthy throughout her life in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006 she missed the opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer. 184 In May 2007 citing unnamed sources The Daily Telegraph reported that Elizabeth was exasperated and frustrated by the policies of Tony Blair that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair. 185 She was however said to admire Blairs efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland . 186 She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007. 187 On 20 March 2008 at the Church of Ireland St Patricks Cathedral Armagh Elizabeth attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales. 188 Elizabeth addressed the UN General Assembly for a second time in 2010 again in her capacity as Queen of all Commonwealth realms and Head of the Commonwealth . 189 The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon introduced her as an anchor for our age . 190 During her visit to New York which followed a tour of Canada she officially opened a memorial garden for British victims of the 911 attacks . 190 Elizabeths 11-day visit to Australia in October 2011 was her 16th visit to the country since 1954. 191 By invitation of the Irish president Mary McAleese she made the first state visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch in May 2011. 192 Diamond Jubilee and milestones Visiting Birmingham in July 2012 as part of the Diamond Jubilee tour The 2012 Diamond Jubilee marked 60 years since Elizabeths accession and celebrations were held throughout her realms the wider Commonwealth and beyond.

In her speech she said she had never aspired to achieve that milestone. 199 In March 2013 the Queen stayed overnight at King Edward VIIs Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis . 200 A week later she signed the new Charter of the Commonwealth . 201 That year because of her age and the need for her to limit travelling she chose not to attend the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for the first time in 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by Prince Charles. 202 On 20 April 2018 the Commonwealth heads of government announced that Charles would succeed her as Head of the Commonwealth which the Queen stated as her sincere wish . 203 She underwent cataract surgery in May 2018. 204 In March 2019 she gave up driving on public roads largely as a consequence of a car accident involving her husband two months earlier. 205 On 21 December 2007 Elizabeth surpassed her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria to become the longest-lived British monarch and she became the longest-reigning British monarch and longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015. 206 She became the oldest living monarch after the death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on 23 January 2015. 207 She later became the longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state following the death of King Bhumibol of Thailand on 13 October 2016 208 and the oldest current head of state on the resignation of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe on 21 November 2017. 209 On 6 February 2017 she became the first British monarch to commemorate a sapphire jubilee 210 and on 20 November that year she was the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary. 211 Philip had retired from his official duties as the Queens consort in August 2017. 212 Pandemic and widowhood On 19 March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United Kingdom Elizabeth moved to Windsor Castle and sequestered there as a precaution. 213 Public engagements were cancelled and Windsor Castle followed a strict sanitary protocol nicknamed HMS Bubble . 214 Virtual meeting with Cindy Kiro during the COVID-19 pandemic October 2021 On 5 April in a televised broadcast watched by an estimated 24 million viewers in the United Kingdom 215 Elizabeth asked people to take comfort that while we may have more still to endure better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again . 216 On 8 May the 75th anniversary of VE Day in a television broadcast at 9 pmthe exact time at which her father had broadcast to the nation on the same day in 1945she asked people to never give up never despair . 217 In 2021 she received her first and second COVID-19 vaccinations in January and April respectively. 218 Prince Philip died on 9 April 2021 after 73 years of marriage making Elizabeth the first British monarch to reign as a widow or widower since Queen Victoria. 219 She was reportedly at her husbands bedside when he died 220 and remarked in private that his death had left a huge void . 221 Due to the COVID-19 restrictions in place in England at the time Elizabeth sat alone at Philips funeral service which evoked sympathy from people around the world. 222 It was later reported in the press that Elizabeth had rejected a government offer to relax the rules. 223 In her Christmas broadcast that year which was ultimately her last she paid a personal tribute to her beloved Philip saying That mischievous inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him. 224 Despite the pandemic Elizabeth attended the 2021 State Opening of Parliament in May 225 the 47th G7 summit in June 226 and hosted US president Joe Biden at Windsor Castle.

She did not attend the state openings in 1959 and 1963 as she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward respectively. 237 The Queen was largely confined to balcony appearances during the public jubilee celebrations and she missed the National Service of Thanksgiving on 3 June. 238 On 13 June she became the second-longest reigning monarch in history among those whose exact dates of reign are known with 70 years and 127 days on the thronesurpassing King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. 239 On 6 September she appointed her 15th British prime minister Liz Truss at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. This was the only occasion on which Elizabeth received a new prime minister at a location other than Buckingham Palace. 240 No other British monarch appointed as many prime ministers. 241 The Queens last public message was issued on 7 September in which she expressed her sympathy for those affected by the Saskatchewan stabbings . 242 Elizabeth did not plan to abdicate 243 though she took on fewer public engagements in her later years and Prince Charles performed more of her duties. 244 She told Canadian governor-general Adrienne Clarkson in a meeting in 2002 that she would never abdicate saying It is not our tradition. Although I suppose if I became completely gaga one would have to do something. 245 In June 2022 Elizabeth met the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby who came away thinking there is someone who has no fear of death has hope in the future knows the rock on which she stands and that gives her strength. 246 Death Main article: Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II Tributes left in The Mall London On 8 September 2022 Buckingham Palace stated Following further evaluation this morning the Queens doctors are concerned for Her Majestys health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral. 247 248 Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral. 249 250 She died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96. 251 252 253 Her death was announced to the public at 18:30 254 255 setting in motion Operation London Bridge and because she died in Scotland Operation Unicorn . 256 257 Elizabeth was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542. 258 Her death certificate recorded her cause of death as old age . 252 259 According to her former prime minister Boris Johnson 260 and the biographer Gyles Brandreth she was suffering from a form of bone marrow cancer which Brandreth wrote was multiple myeloma . 261 On 12 September Elizabeths coffin was carried up the Royal Mile in a procession to St Giles Cathedral where the Crown of Scotland was placed on it. 262 Her coffin lay at rest at the cathedral for 24 hours guarded by the Royal Company of Archers during which around 33 000 people filed past it. 263 On 13 September the coffin was flown to RAF Northolt in west London to be met by Liz Truss before continuing its journey by road to Buckingham Palace. 264 On 14 September her coffin was taken in a military procession to Westminster Hall where Elizabeths body lay in state for four days. The coffin was guarded by members of both the Sovereigns Bodyguard and the Household Division . An estimated 250 000 members of the public filed past the coffin as did politicians and other public figures. 265 266 On 16 September Elizabeths children held a vigil around her coffin and the next day her eight grandchildren did the same. 267 268 Elizabeths coffin on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy during the procession to Wellington Arch Elizabeths state funeral was held at Westminster Abbey on 19 September which marked the first time a monarchs funeral service was held at the Abbey since George II in 1760. 269 More than a million people lined the streets of central London 270 and the day was declared a holiday in several Commonwealth countries. In Windsor a final procession involving 1 000 military personnel took place which 97 000 people witnessed. 271 270 Elizabeths fell pony and two royal corgis stood at the side of the procession. 272 After a committal service at St Georges Chapel Windsor Castle Elizabeths body was interred with her husband Philips in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later the same day in a private ceremony attended by her closest family members. 273 271 274 275 Legacy Main article: Personality and image of Elizabeth II Beliefs activities and interests Patting a dog in New Zealand 1974 Elizabeth rarely gave interviews and little was known of her political opinions which she did not express explicitly in public. It is against convention to ask or reveal the monarchs views. When Times journalist Paul Routledge asked her about the miners strike of 198485 during a royal tour of the newspapers offices she replied that it was all about one man a reference to Arthur Scargill 276 with which Routledge disagreed. 277 Routledge was widely criticised in the media for asking the question and claimed that he was unaware of the protocols. 277 After the 2014 Scottish independence referendum Prime Minister David Cameron was overheard saying that Elizabeth was pleased with the outcome. 278 She had arguably issued a public coded statement about the referendum by telling one woman outside Balmoral Kirk that she hoped people would think very carefully about the outcome. It emerged later that Cameron had specifically requested that she register her concern. 279 Elizabeth had a deep sense of religious and civic duty and took her Coronation Oath seriously. 280 Aside from her official religious role as supreme governor of the established Church of England she worshipped with that church and with the national Church of Scotland . 281 She demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and met with leaders of other churches and religions including five popes: Pius XII John XXIII John Paul II Benedict XVI and Francis . 282 A personal note about her faith often featured in her annual Christmas Message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000 she said: 283 To many of us our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I like so many of you have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christs words and example. Elizabeth was patron of more than 600 organisations and charities. 284 The Charities Aid Foundation estimated that Elizabeth helped raise over 1.4 billion for her patronages during her reign. 285 Her main leisure interests included equestrianism and dogs especially her Pembroke Welsh Corgis . 286 Her lifelong love of corgis began in 1933 with Dookie the first of many royal corgis . 287 Scenes of a relaxed informal home life were occasionally witnessed; she and her family from time to time prepared a meal together and washed the dishes afterwards. 288 Media depiction and public opinion In the 1950s as a young woman at the start of her reign Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous fairytale Queen . 289 After the trauma of the Second World War it was a time of hope a period of progress and achievement heralding a new Elizabethan age . 290 Lord Altrinchams accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a priggish schoolgirl was an extremely rare criticism. 291 In the late 1960s attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charless investiture as Prince of Wales . 292 Elizabeth also instituted other new practices; her first royal walkabout meeting ordinary members of the public took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970. 293 Her wardrobe developed a recognisable signature style driven more by function than fashion. 294 In public she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats allowing her to be seen easily in a crowd. 295 By the end of her reign nearly one third of Britons had seen or met Elizabeth in person. 296 At Elizabeths Silver Jubilee in 1977 the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic; 297 but in the 1980s public criticism of the royal family increased as the personal and working lives of Elizabeths children came under media scrutiny. 298 Her popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion she began to pay income tax for the first time and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. 299 Although support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory republican ideology was still a minority viewpoint and Elizabeth herself had high approval ratings. 300 Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the conduct of Elizabeths wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. 301 Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana Princess of Wales although Elizabeths personal popularityas well as general support for the monarchyrebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Dianas death. 302 In Brisbane Australia 1982 In November 1999 a referendum in Australia on the future of the Australian monarchy favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state. 303 Many republicans credited Elizabeths personal popularity with the survival of the monarchy in Australia. In 2010 Prime Minister Julia Gillard noted that there was a deep affection for Elizabeth in Australia and that another referendum on the monarchy should wait until after her reign. 304 Gillards successor Malcolm Turnbull who led the republican campaign in 1999 similarly believed that Australians would not vote to become a republic in her lifetime. 305 Shes been an extraordinary head of state Turnbull said in 2021 and I think frankly in Australia there are more Elizabethans than there are monarchists. 306 Similarly referendums in both Tuvalu in 2008 and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009 saw voters reject proposals to become republics. 307 Polls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for the monarchy 308 and in 2012 Elizabeths Diamond Jubilee year her approval ratings hit 90 per cent. 309 Her family came under scrutiny again in the last few years of her life due to her son Andrews association with convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell his lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre amidst accusations of sexual impropriety and her grandson Harry and his wife Meghan s exit from the working royal family and subsequent move to the United States. 310 Polling in Great Britain during the Platinum Jubilee however showed support for maintaining the monarchy 311 and Elizabeths personal popularity remained strong. 312 As of 2021 she remained the third most admired woman in the world according to the annual Gallup poll her 52 appearances on the list meaning she had been in the top ten more than any other woman in the polls history. 313 Elizabeth was portrayed in a variety of media by many notable artists including painters Pietro Annigoni Peter Blake Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy Terence Cuneo Lucian Freud Rolf Harris Damien Hirst Juliet Pannett and Tai-Shan Schierenberg . 314 315 Notable photographers of Elizabeth included Cecil Beaton Yousuf Karsh Anwar Hussein Annie Leibovitz Lord Lichfield Terry ONeill John Swannell and Dorothy Wilding . The first official portrait photograph of Elizabeth was taken by Marcus Adams in 1926. 316 Titles styles honours and arms Main article: List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II Royal cypher of Elizabeth II surmounted by St Edwards Crown Personal flag of Elizabeth II Titles and styles Elizabeth held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth was sovereign of many orders in her own countries and received honours and awards from around the world.
