He was created Prince of Wales in 1958 and his investiture was held in 1969. He was educated at Cheam School and Gordonstoun and later spent six months at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria Australia. After completing a history degree from the University of Cambridge Charles served in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976. In 1981 he married Lady Diana Spencer . They had two sons William and Harry . Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after they had each engaged in well-publicised extramarital affairs. Diana died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash the following year. In 2005 Charles married his long-term partner Camilla Parker Bowles . As heir apparent Charles undertook official duties and engagements on behalf of his mother. He founded the Princes Trust in 1976 sponsored the Princes Charities and became patron or president of more than 800 other charities and organisations. He advocated for the conservation of historic buildings and the importance of architecture in society. In that vein he generated the experimental new town of Poundbury . An environmentalist Charles supported organic farming and action to prevent climate change during his time as the manager of the Duchy of Cornwall estates earning him awards and recognition as well as criticism; he is also a prominent critic of the adoption of genetically modified food while his support for alternative medicine has been criticised. He has authored or co-authored 17 books . Charles became king upon his mothers death in 2022. At the age of 73 he was the oldest person to accede to the British throne after having been the longest-serving heir apparent and Prince of Wales in British history. Significant events in his reign have included his coronation in 2023 and his cancer diagnosis the following year the latter of which temporarily suspended planned public engagements. Early life family and education Christening of Charles centre wearing the royal christening gown in 1948: from left to right his grandfather King George VI; his mother Princess Elizabeth holding him; his father Philip; and his grandmother Queen Elizabeth Charles was born at 21:14 GMT on 14 November 1948 3 during the reign of his maternal grandfather King George VI as the first child of Princess Elizabeth Duchess of Edinburgh later Queen Elizabeth II and Philip Duke of Edinburgh . 4 He was delivered by Caesarean section at Buckingham Palace. 5 His parents had three more children Anne born 1950 Andrew born 1960 and Edward born 1964. He was christened Charles Philip Arthur George on 15 December 1948 in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher . e f 9 10 George VI died on 6 February 1952 and Charless mother acceded to the throne as Elizabeth II; Charles immediately became the heir apparent . Under a charter of Edward III in 1337 and as the monarchs eldest son he automatically assumed the traditional titles of Duke of Cornwall and in the Scottish peerage the titles Duke of Rothesay Earl of Carrick Baron of Renfrew Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland . 11 The following year Charles attended his mothers coronation at Westminster Abbey . 12 When Charles turned five Catherine Peebles was appointed as governess to oversee his education at Buckingham Palace. 13 He then commenced classes at Hill House School in west London in November 1956. 14 Charles was the first heir apparent to attend school rather than be educated by a private tutor. 15 He did not receive preferential treatment from the schools founder and headmaster Stuart Townend who advised the Queen to have Charles train in football because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field. 16 Charles subsequently attended two of his fathers former schools: Cheam School in Hampshire 17 from 1958 18 followed by Gordonstoun in the north-east of Scotland beginning classes there in April 1962. 18 19 He later became patron of Gordonstoun in May 2024. 20 With his parents and sister Anne October 1957 In his 1994 authorised biography by Jonathan Dimbleby Charless parents were described as physically and emotionally distant and Philip was blamed for his disregard of Charless sensitive nature including forcing him to attend Gordonstoun where he was bullied. 21 Though Charles reportedly described Gordonstoun noted for its especially rigorous curriculum as Colditz in kilts 17 he later praised the school stating it had taught him a great deal about myself and my own abilities and disabilities . He said in a 1975 interview he was glad he had attended Gordonstoun and that the toughness of the place was much exaggerated . 22 In 1966 Charles spent two terms at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria Australia during which time he visited Papua New Guinea on a school trip with his history tutor Michael Collins Persse. 23 24 In 1973 Charles described his time at Timbertop as the most enjoyable part of his whole education. 25 Upon his return to Gordonstoun he emulated his father in becoming head boy and left in 1967 with six GCE O-levels and two A-levels in history and French at grades B and C respectively. 23 26 On his education Charles later remarked I didnt enjoy school as much as I might have; but that was only because Im happier at home than anywhere else . 22 Charles broke royal tradition when he proceeded straight to university after his A-levels rather than joining the British Armed Forces . 17 In October 1967 he was admitted to Trinity College Cambridge where he studied archaeology and anthropology for the first part of the Tripos and then switched to history for the second part. 9 23 27 During his second year he attended the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth studying Welsh history and the Welsh language for one term. 23 Charles became the first British heir apparent to earn a university degree graduating in June 1970 from the University of Cambridge with a 2:2 Bachelor of Arts BA degree. 23 28 Following standard practice in August 1975 his Bachelor of Arts was promoted to a Master of Arts MA Cantab degree. 23 Prince of Wales Charles was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on 26 July 1958 29 though his investiture was not held until 1 July 1969 when he was crowned by his mother in a televised ceremony held at Caernarfon Castle ; 30 the investiture was controversial in Wales owing to growing Welsh nationalist sentiment. 31 He took his seat in the House of Lords the following year 32 and he delivered his maiden speech on 13 June 1974 33 the first royal to speak from the floor since the future Edward VII in 1884. 34 He spoke again in 1975. 35 Charles began to take on more public duties founding the Princes Trust in 1976 36 and travelling to the United States in 1981. 37 In the mid-1970s he expressed an interest in serving as governor-general of Australia at the suggestion of Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser ; however because of a lack of public enthusiasm nothing came of the proposal. 38 In reaction Charles commented so what are you supposed to think when you are prepared to do something to help and you are just told youre not wanted? 39 Military training and career Charles served in the Royal Air Force RAF and the Royal Navy. During his second year at Cambridge he received Royal Air Force training learning to fly the Chipmunk aircraft with the Cambridge University Air Squadron 40 41 and was presented with his RAF wings in August 1971. 42 Front to back HMS Norfolk London and Antrim in the English Channel following joint exercises with the RAF in December 1971. Charles was serving aboard the Norfolk at this time. After the passing-out parade that September Charles embarked on a naval career and enrolled in a six-week course at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth . He then served from 1971 to 1972 on the guided-missile destroyer HMS Norfolk and the frigates HMS Minerva from 1972 to 1973 and HMS Jupiter in 1974. That same year he also qualified as a helicopter pilot at RNAS Yeovilton and subsequently joined 845 Naval Air Squadron operating from HMS Hermes . 43 Charles spent his last 10 months of active service in the Navy commanding the coastal minehunter HMS Bronington beginning on 9 February 1976. 43 He took part in a parachute training course at RAF Brize Norton two years later after being appointed colonel-in-chief of the Parachute Regiment in 1977. 44 Charles gave up flying after crash-landing a BAe 146 in Islay in 1994 as a passenger who was invited to fly the aircraft; the crew was found negligent by a board of inquiry. 45 Relationships and marriages Bachelorhood In his youth Charles was amorously linked to a number of women. His girlfriends included Georgiana Russell the daughter of Sir John Russell who was the British ambassador to Spain ; 46 Lady Jane Wellesley the daughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington ; 47 Davina Sheffield; 48 Lady Sarah Spencer ; 49 and Camilla Shand who later became his second wife. 50 Photograph by Allan Warren 1972 Charless great-uncle Lord Mountbatten advised him to sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down but for a wife he should choose a suitable attractive and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for ... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage . 51 Early in 1974 Mountbatten began corresponding with 25-year-old Charles about a potential marriage to Amanda Knatchbull Mountbattens granddaughter. 52 Charles wrote to Amandas mother Lady Brabourne who was also his godmother expressing interest in her daughter. Lady Brabourne replied approvingly but suggested that a courtship with a 16-year-old was premature. 53 Four years later Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 visit to India. Both fathers however objected; Prince Philip feared that his famous uncle g would eclipse Charles while Lord Brabourne warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple. 54 In August 1979 before Charles would depart alone for India Mountbatten was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army . When Charles returned he proposed to Amanda. But in addition to her grandfather she had lost her paternal grandmother and younger brother in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family. 54 Lady Diana Spencer Further information: Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer With Diana during their visit to Uluru in Australia March 1983 Charles first met Lady Diana Spencer in 1977 while he was visiting her home Althorp . He was then the companion of her elder sister Sarah and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friends barbecue in July she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten. Soon according to Dimbleby without any apparent surge in feeling he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride and she accompanied Charles on visits to Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House . 55 Charless cousin Norton Knatchbull and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her. 56 Meanwhile the couples continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and paparazzi. When Charless father told him that the media speculation would injure Dianas reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon and realising that she was a suitable royal bride according to Mountbattens criteria Charles construed his fathers advice as a warning to proceed without further delay. 57 He proposed to Diana in February 1981 with their engagement becoming official on 24 February; the wedding took place in St Pauls Cathedral on 29 July. Upon his marriage Charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits of the Duchy of Cornwall from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. 58 The couple lived at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House near Tetbury and had two children: William in 1982 and Harry in 1984. 15 With Diana at the Alberta Legislature Building in Edmonton Canada June 1983 Within five years the marriage was in trouble due to the couples incompatibility and near 13-year age difference. 59 60 In 1986 Charles had fully resumed his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. 61 In a videotape recorded by Peter Settelen in 1992 Diana admitted that from 1985 to 1986 she had been deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment. 62 63 It was assumed that she was referring to Barry Mannakee 64 who had been transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986 after his managers determined his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate. 63 65 Diana later commenced a relationship with Major James Hewitt the familys former riding instructor. 66 Charles and Dianas evident discomfort in each others company led to them being dubbed The Glums by the press. 67 Diana exposed Charless affair with Parker Bowles in a book by Andrew Morton Diana: Her True Story . Audio tapes of her own extramarital flirtations also surfaced 67 as did persistent suggestions that Hewitt is Prince Harrys father based on a physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry. However Harry had already been born by the time Dianas affair with Hewitt began. 68 In December 1992 John Major announced the couples legal separation in the House of Commons . Early the following year the British press published transcripts of a passionate bugged telephone conversation between Charles and Parker Bowles that had taken place in 1989 which was dubbed Camillagate and Tampongate . 69 Charles subsequently sought public understanding in a television film with Dimbleby Charles: The Private Man the Public Role broadcast in June 1994. In an interview in the film Charles confirmed his own extramarital affair with Parker Bowles saying that he had rekindled their association in 1986 only after his marriage to Diana had irretrievably broken down . 70 71 This was followed by Dianas own admission of marital troubles in an interview on the BBC current affairs show Panorama broadcast in November 1995. 72 Referring to Charless relationship with Parker Bowles she said well there were three of us in this marriage. So it was a bit crowded. She also expressed doubt about her husbands suitability for kingship. 73 Charles and Diana divorced on 28 August 1996 74 after being advised by the Queen in December 1995 to end the marriage. 75 The couple shared custody of their children. 76 Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. Charles flew to Paris with Dianas sisters to accompany her body back to Britain. 77 In 2003 Dianas butler Paul Burrell published a note that he claimed had been written by Diana in 1995 in which there were allegations that Charles was planning an accident in Dianas car brake failure and serious head injury so that he could remarry. 78 When questioned by the Metropolitan Police inquiry team as a part of Operation Paget Charles told the authorities that he did not know about his former wifes note from 1995 and could not understand why she had those feelings. 79 Camilla Parker Bowles Main article: Wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles With Camilla in Jamaica March 2008 In 1999 Charles and Parker Bowles made their first public appearance as a couple at the Ritz London Hotel and she moved into Charless official residence Clarence House in 2003. 80 81 Their engagement was announced on 10 February 2005. 82 The Queens consent to the marriage as required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772 was recorded in a Privy Council meeting on 2 March. 83 In Canada the Department of Justice determined the consent of the Queens Privy Council for Canada was not required as the union would not produce any heirs to the Canadian throne . 84 Charles was the only member of the royal family to have a civil rather than a church wedding in England. British government documents from the 1950s and 1960s published by the BBC stated that such a marriage was illegal; these claims were dismissed by Charless spokesman 85 and explained by the sitting government to have been repealed by the Registration Service Act 1953. 86 The union was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle with a subsequent religious blessing at the castles St Georges Chapel . The wedding venue was changed to Windsor Guildhall after it was realised a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. Four days before the event it was postponed from the originally scheduled date of 8 April until the following day in order to allow Charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II . 87 Charless parents did not attend the marriage ceremony; the Queens reluctance to attend possibly arose from her position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England . 88 However his parents did attend the service of blessing and held a reception for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle. 89 The blessing by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was televised. 90 Official duties See also: List of official overseas trips made by Charles III With Harichand Megha Dalaya at Amul in Anand Gujarat December 1980 In 1965 Charles undertook his first public engagement by attending a student garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse . 91 During his time as Prince of Wales he undertook official duties on behalf of the Queen 92 completing 10 934 engagements between 2002 and 2022. 93 He officiated at investitures and attended the funerals of foreign dignitaries. 94 Charles made regular tours of Wales fulfilling a week of engagements each summer and attending important national occasions such as opening the Senedd . 95 The six trustees of the Royal Collection Trust met three times a year under his chairmanship. 96 Charles also represented his mother at the independence celebrations in Fiji in 1970 97 The Bahamas in 1973 98 Papua New Guinea in 1975 99 Zimbabwe in 1980 100 and Brunei in 1984. 101 In 1983 Christopher John Lewis who had fired a shot with a .22 rifle at the Queen in 1981 attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Charles who was visiting New Zealand with Diana and William. 102 While Charles was visiting Australia on Australia Day in January 1994 David Kang fired two shots at him from a starting pistol in protest of the treatment of several hundred Cambodian asylum seekers held in detention camps. 103 In 1995 Charles became the first member of the royal family to visit the Republic of Ireland in an official capacity. 104 In 1997 he represented the Queen at the Hong Kong handover ceremony . 105 106 Charless ninth tour of New Zealand November 2015 At the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005 Charles caused controversy when he shook hands with the president of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe who had been seated next to him.

The British Embassy called the trip an important step in promoting peace and reconciliation . 111 During the trip he shook hands in Galway with Gerry Adams leader of Sinn Fein and widely believed to be the leader of the IRA the militant group that had assassinated Lord Mountbatten in 1979. The event was described by the media as a historic handshake and a significant moment for Anglo-Irish relations . 112 With Queen Elizabeth II and other world leaders to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day on 5 June 2019 Commonwealth heads of government decided at their 2018 meeting that Charles would be the next Head of the Commonwealth after the Queen. 113 The head is chosen and therefore not hereditary. 114 In March 2019 at the request of the British government Charles and Camilla went on an official tour of Cuba making them the first British royals to visit the country. The tour was seen as an effort to form a closer relationship between Cuba and the United Kingdom. 115 Charles contracted COVID-19 during the pandemic in March 2020. 116 117 Several newspapers were critical that Charles and Camilla were tested promptly at a time when many NHS doctors nurses and patients had been unable to be tested expeditiously. 118 He tested positive for COVID-19 for a second time in February 2022. 119 He and Camilla who also tested positive had received doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021. 120 Delivering the Queens Speech to the British Parliament on behalf of his mother May 2022 Charles attended the November 2021 ceremonies to mark Barbadoss transition into a parliamentary republic abolishing the position of monarch of Barbados . 121 He was invited by Prime Minister Mia Mottley as the future Head of the Commonwealth; 122 it was the first time that a member of the royal family attended the transition of a realm to a republic. 123 In May of the following year Charles attended the State Opening of the British Parliament delivering the Queens Speech on behalf of his mother as a counsellor of state . 124 Reign Further information: Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II and Proclamation of accession of Charles III Addressing the Scottish Parliament on 13 September 2022 Charles acceded to the British throne on his mothers death on 8 September 2022.

In the 1985 Royal Special television programme he told host Alastair Burnet that I actually now dont eat as much meat as I used to. I eat more fish. He also pointed out the societal double standard whereby eating meat is not questioned but eating less meat means all hell seems to break loose. 159 In 2021 Charles spoke to the BBC about the environment and revealed that two days per week he eats no meat nor fish and one day per week he eats no dairy products. 160 In 2022 it was reported that he eats a breakfast of fruit salad seeds and tea.

Instead he was served lobster. 163 Charity work Since founding the Princes Trust in 1976 using his 7 500 of severance pay from the Navy 164 Charles has established 16 more charitable organisations and now serves as president of each. 165 92 Together they form a loose alliance the Princes Charities which describes itself as the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom raising over 100 million annually ... and is active across a broad range of areas including education and young people environmental sustainability the built environment responsible business and enterprise and international . 165 As Prince of Wales Charles became patron or president of over 800 other charities and organisations. 91 The Princes Charities Canada was established in 2010 in a similar fashion to its namesake in Britain. 166 Charles uses his tours of Canada as a way to help draw attention to youth the disabled the environment the arts medicine the elderly heritage conservation and education. 167 He has also set up the Princes Charities Australia based in Melbourne to provide a coordinating presence for his Australian and international charitable endeavours. 168 With Camilla visiting the African American Heritage Center in Louisville Kentucky March 2015 Charles has supported humanitarian projects; for example he and his sons took part in ceremonies that marked the 1998 International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination . 167 Charles was one of the first public figures to express strong concerns about the human rights record of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu initiating objections in the international arena 169 and subsequently supported the FARA Foundation 9 a charity for Romanian orphans and abandoned children. 170 Investigations of donations Main articles: The Kings Foundation Cash for honours allegations and other donations and King Charles III Charitable Fund Qatari donations Two of Charless charities the Princes Foundation and the Prince of Waless Charitable Fund later renamed the Kings Foundation and King Charles III Charitable Fund respectively came under scrutiny in 2021 and 2022 for accepting donations the media deemed inappropriate. In August 2021 it was announced that the Princes Foundation was launching an investigation into the reports 171 with Charless support. 172 The Charity Commission also launched an investigation into allegations that the donations meant for the Princes Foundation had been instead sent to the Mahfouz Foundation. 173 In February 2022 the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into the cash-for-honours allegations linked to the foundation 174 passing their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service for deliberation in October. 175 In August 2023 the Metropolitan Police announced that they had concluded their investigations and no further actions would be taken. 176 The Times reported in June 2022 that between 2011 and 2015 Charles accepted 3 million in cash from Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani . 177 178 There was no evidence that the payments were illegal or that it was not intended for the money to go to the charity 178 although the Charity Commission stated it would review the information 179 and announced in July 2022 that there would be no further investigation. 180 In the same month The Times reported that the Prince of Waless Charitable Fund received a donation of 1 million from Bakr bin Laden and Shafiq bin Laden both half-brothers of Osama bin Laden during a private meeting in 2013. 181 182 The Charity Commission described the decision to accept donations as a matter for trustees and added that no investigation was required. 183 Personal interests With Boris Johnson at the 2022 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali Rwanda From young adulthood Charles encouraged understanding of Indigenous voices claiming they held crucial messages about preservation of the land respecting community and shared values resolving conflict and recognising and making good on past iniquities. 184 He dovetailed this view with his efforts against climate change 185 as well as reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and his charitable work in Canada. 186 187 At CHOGM 2022 Charles who was representing his mother raised that reconciliation process as an example for dealing with the history of slavery in the British Empire 188 for which he expressed his sorrow. 189 Letters sent by Charles to government ministers in 2004 and 2005 expressing his concerns over various policy issues the so-called black spider memos presented potential embarrassment following a challenge by The Guardian newspaper to release the letters under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 . In March 2015 the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom decided that Charless letters must be released. 190 The Cabinet Office published the letters in May 2015. 191 The reaction was largely supportive of Charles with little criticism of him; 192 the press variously described the memos as underwhelming 193 and harmless 194 and concluded that their release had backfired on those who seek to belittle him . 195 It was revealed in the same year that Charles had access to confidential Cabinet papers. 196 In October 2020 a letter sent by Charles to the governor-general of Australia Sir John Kerr after Kerrs dismissal of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975 was released as part of the collection of palace letters regarding the Australian constitutional crisis. 197 In the letter Charles was supportive of Kerrs decision writing that what Kerr did last year was right and the courageous thing to do . 197 Meeting with Ruth Davidson and Nicola Sturgeon after the Kirking of the Scottish Parliament May 2016 The Times reported in June 2022 that Charles had privately described the British governments Rwanda asylum plan as appalling and he feared that it would overshadow the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda that same month. 198 It was later claimed that Cabinet ministers had warned Charles to avoid making political comments as they feared a constitutional crisis could arise if he continued to make such statements once he became king. 199 200 Built environment Charles has openly expressed his views on architecture and urban planning ; he fostered the advancement of New Classical architecture and asserted that he cares deeply about issues such as the environment architecture inner-city renewal and the quality of life. 201 In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects in May 1984 he described a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London as a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend and deplored the glass stumps and concrete towers of modern architecture. 202 Charles called for local community involvement in architectural choices and asked why has everything got to be vertical straight unbending only at right angles and functional? 202 Charles has a deep understanding of Islamic art and architecture and has been involved in the construction of a building and garden at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies which combine Islamic and Oxford architectural styles. 203 At the newly opened At-Bristol June 2000 In Charless 1989 book A Vision of Britain and in speeches and essays he has been critical of modern architecture arguing that traditional designs and methods should guide contemporary ones. 204 He has continued to campaign for traditional urbanism human scale restoration of historic buildings and sustainable design 205 despite criticism in the press. 206 Two of his charities the Princes Regeneration Trust and the Princes Foundation for Building Community which were later merged into one charity promote his views. The village of Poundbury was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall to a master plan by Leon Krier under the guidance of Charles and in line with his philosophy. 201 In 2013 developments for the suburb of Nansledan began on the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall with Charless endorsement. 207 Charles helped purchase Dumfries House and its complete collection of 18th century furnishings in 2007 taking a 20m loan from his charitable trust to contribute toward the 45m cost. 208 The house and gardens remain property of the Princes Foundation and serve as a museum and community and skills training centre. 209 210 This led to the development of Knockroon called the Scottish Poundbury . 211 212 After lamenting in 1996 the unbridled destruction of many of Canadas historic urban cores Charles offered his assistance to the Department of Canadian Heritage in creating a trust modelled on Britains National Trust a plan that was implemented with the passage of the federal budget in 2007 . 213 In 1999 Charles agreed to the use of his title for the Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership awarded by the National Trust for Canada to municipal governments that have committed to the conservation of historic places. 214 Whilst visiting the US and surveying the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina Charles received the National Building Museum s Vincent Scully Prize in 2005 for his efforts in regard to architecture; he donated 25 000 of the prize money towards restoring storm-damaged communities. 215 For his work as patron of New Classical architecture Charles was awarded the 2012 Driehaus Architecture Prize from the University of Notre Dame . 216 The Worshipful Company of Carpenters installed Charles as an Honorary Liveryman in recognition of his interest in Londons architecture. 217 Charles has occasionally intervened in projects that employ architectural styles such as modernism and functionalism . 218 219 In 2009 Charles wrote to the Qatari royal family the financier of the redevelopment of the Chelsea Barracks site labelling Lord Rogers s design for the site unsuitable . Rogers claimed that Charles had also intervened to block his designs for the Royal Opera House and Paternoster Square . 220 CPC Group the project developer took a case against Qatari Diar to the High Court . 221 After the suit was settled the CPC Group apologised to Charles for any offence caused ... during the course of the proceedings . 221 Natural environment Addressing the opening of the Paris Climate Change Conference November 2015 Since the 1970s Charles has promoted environmental awareness. 222 At the age of 21 he delivered his first speech on environmental issues in his capacity as the chairman of the Welsh Countryside Committee. 223 An avid gardener Charles has also emphasised the importance of talking to plants stating that I happily talk to the plants and trees and listen to them. I think its absolutely crucial . 224 His interest in gardening began in 1980 when he took over the Highgrove estate. 225 His healing garden based on sacred geometry and ancient religious symbolism went on display at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2002. 225 Upon moving into Highgrove House Charles developed an interest in organic farming which culminated in the 1990 launch of his own organic brand Duchy Originals 226 which sells more than 200 different sustainably produced products; the profits over 6 million by 2010 are donated to the Princes Charities. 226 227 Charles became involved with farming and various industries within it regularly meeting with farmers to discuss their trade. A prominent critic of the practice 228 Charles has also spoken against the use of GM crops and in a letter to Tony Blair in 1998 Charles criticised the development of genetically modified foods. 229 The Sustainable Markets Initiative a project that encourages putting sustainability at the centre of all activities was launched by Charles at the World Economic Forum s annual meeting in Davos in January 2020. 230 In May of the same year the initiative and the World Economic Forum initiated the Great Reset project a five-point plan concerned with enhancing sustainable economic growth following the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic . 231 With Camilla visiting Hackney City Farm in East London May 2009 The holy chrism oil used at Charless coronation was vegan made from oils of olive sesame rose jasmine cinnamon neroli and benzoin along with amber and orange blossom.

That year Ernst published a book with Simon Singh called Trick or Treatment: Alternative Medicine on Trial and mockingly dedicated to HRH the Prince of Wales . The last chapter is highly critical of Charless advocacy of complementary and alternative treatments. 245 Charless Duchy Originals produced a variety of complementary medicinal products including a Detox Tincture that Ernst denounced as financially exploiting the vulnerable and outright quackery . 246 Charles personally wrote at least seven letters 247 to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency shortly before it relaxed the rules governing labelling of such herbal products a move that was widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies. 248 It was reported in October 2009 that Charles had lobbied the health secretary Andy Burnham regarding greater provision of alternative treatments in the NHS. 246 Following accounting irregularities the FIH announced its closure in April 2010. 249 250 The FIH was re-branded and re-launched later in 2010 as the College of Medicine 250 251 of which Charles became a patron in 2019. 252 Sports Charles at front at the 2005 Chakravarty Cup Match at Ham Polo Club June 2005 From his youth until 2005 Charles was an avid player of competitive polo . 253 Charles also frequently took part in fox hunting until the sport was banned in the United Kingdom also in 2005. 254 By the late 1990s opposition to the activity was growing when Charless participation was viewed as a political statement by those who were opposed to it. 255 Charles suffered several polo and hunting-related injuries throughout the years including a two-inch scar on his left cheek in 1980 a broken arm in 1990 a torn cartilage in his left knee in 1992 a broken rib in 1998 and a fractured shoulder in 2001. 149 Charles has been a keen salmon angler since youth and supported Orri Vigfusson s efforts to protect the North Atlantic salmon.
