Early life Main article: Early life and work of Clint Eastwood Eastwood was born on May 31 1930 at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco to Ruth nee Margret b Runner; 19092006 and Clinton Eastwood 19061970. During her sons fame Ruth was known by the surname of her second husband John Belden Wood 19132004 whom she married after the death of Clinton Sr. 10 Eastwood was nicknamed Samson by hospital nurses because he weighed 11 pounds 6 ounces 5.2 kg at birth. 11 12 He has a younger sister Jeanne Bernhardt b. 1934. 13 He is of English Irish Scottish and Dutch ancestry. 14 Eastwood is descended from Mayflower passenger William Bradford and through this line is the 12th generation born in North America. 15 16 17 His family relocated three times during the 1930s as his father changed occupations. 18 19 Contrary to what Eastwood has indicated in media interviews they did not move between 1940 and 1949. 20 21 Settling in Piedmont California the Eastwoods lived in an affluent area of the town had a swimming pool belonged to a country club and each parent drove their own car. 22 Eastwoods father was a manufacturing executive at Georgia-Pacific for most of his working life. 23 As Clint and Jeanne grew older Ruth took a clerical job at IBM . 24 Eastwood attended Piedmont Middle School 25 where he was held back due to poor academic scores and records indicated he also had to attend summer school. 20 From January 1945 until at least January 1946 he attended Piedmont High School but was asked to leave for writing an obscene suggestion to a school official on the athletic field scoreboard and burning an effigy on the school lawn on top of other school infractions. 26 He transferred to Oakland Technical High School and was scheduled to graduate mid-year in January 1949 although it is not clear if he did. 21 Clint graduated from the airplane shop. I think that was his major joked classmate Don Kincade. 21 Another high school friend Don Loomis echoed I dont think he was spending that much time at school because he was having a pretty good time elsewhere. 21 Fritz Manes a boyhood friend two years younger than Eastwood said I think what happened is he just went off and started having a good time. I just dont think he finished high school. 21 Biographer Patrick McGilligan notes that high school graduation records are a matter of strict legal confidentiality. 21 According to the author Eastwoods school principal had to call his management first before deciding whether to be interviewed and whoever answered the phone at Malpaso advised him against talking to me and he didnt . 27 Eastwood held a number of odd jobs including lifeguard paper carrier grocery clerk forest firefighter and golf caddy. 28 Eastwood said that he tried to enroll at Seattle University in 1951 29 but instead was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War . 30 He always dropped the Korean War reference hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and might be some sort of hero. Actually hed been a lifeguard at Fort Ord in northern California for his entire stint in the military said Eastwoods former longtime companion Sondra Locke . 22 Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings. 31 While returning from a prearranged tryst 31 in Seattle he was a passenger on a Douglas AD bomber that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near Point Reyes . 32 33 Using a life raft he and the pilot swam 2 miles 3.2 km to safety. 34 Eastwood was discharged in February 1953. 35 Career 19541962: acting debut and Rawhide Eastwood alongside Nina Foch in an episode of Rawhide 1959 According to a CBS press release for Rawhide Universal-International s camera crew was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director 36 although this is disputed by Eastwoods unauthorized biographer Patrick McGilligan. 37 According to Eastwoods official biography the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. 36 While in Los Angeles Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak him into a Universal studio where he introduced him to cameraman Irving Glassberg . 36 Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin who although very impressed with Eastwoods appearance and stature then 6 ft 4 in 193 cm disapproved of his acting remarking He was quite amateurish. He didnt know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything. 38 Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwoods initial contract in April 1954 at 100 per week. 38 After signing Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth a lifelong trademark. 39 In May 1954 Eastwood made his first real audition for Six Bridges to Cross but was rejected by Joseph Pevney . 40 After many unsuccessful auditions he was eventually given a minor role by director Jack Arnold in Revenge of the Creature 1955 a sequel to the recently released Creature from the Black Lagoon . 41 In September 1954 Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubins Lady Godiva of Coventry won a role in February 1955 playing Jonesy a sailor in Francis in the Navy and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film Tarantula where he played a squadron pilot. 42 43 In May 1955 Eastwood put four hours work into the film Never Say Goodbye and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand his first western film in August 1955 with Law Man also known as Star in the Dust starring John Agar and Mamie Van Doren . 44 Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2 1955 on NBC s Allen in Movieland which starred comedian Steve Allen actor Tony Curtis and swing musician Benny Goodman . 45 Although he continued to develop as an actor Universal terminated his contract on October 23 1955. 46 Eastwood joined the Marsh Agency and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in The First Traveling Saleslady 1956 and later hired him for Escapade in Japan 1957 without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling. 47 On his financial advisor Irving Leonard s advice he switched to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC s Readers Digest series and as a motorcycle gang member on a Highway Patrol episode. 47 In 1957 Eastwood played a cadet in West Point series and a suicidal gold prospector on Death Valley Days . 48 In 1958 he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of Navy Log and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance as Red Hardigan on Maverick opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money. 48 Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in Lafayette Escadrille 1958 and played a major role as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in Ambush at Cimarron Pass also 1958: a film that Eastwood considers the low point of his career. 49 50 51 Eastwood in 1961 In 1958 Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates in the CBS hour-long western series Rawhide the career breakthrough he had long sought. 52 53 Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30 and Rowdy was too young and cloddish for his comfort. 54 Filming began in Arizona in the summer of 1958. 55 It took just three weeks for Rawhide to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy it was a major success for several years and peaked at number six in the ratings from October 1960 to April 1961. 56 The Rawhide years 195965 were some of the most grueling of Eastwoods career often filming six days a week for an average of 12 hours a day but some directors still criticized him for not working hard enough. 56 57 By late 1963 Rawhide was beginning to decline in the ratings and lacked freshness in the scripts; it was canceled in the middle of the 196566 season. 58 Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show but was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. 59 In the shows first season Eastwood earned 750 an episode. At the time of Rawhide s cancellation he received 119 000 an episode as severance pay. 60 19631969: spaghetti Westerns and stardom In late 1963 Eastwoods Rawhide co-star Eric Fleming rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called A Fistful of Dollars 1964 filmed in a remote region of Spain by a then relatively unknown director Sergio Leone . 61 Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew that Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his Rawhide image. He signed a contract for 15 000 in wages for eleven weeks work with a bonus of a Mercedes-Benz automobile upon completion. 62 63 Eastwood later said of the transition from a TV western to A Fistful of Dollars : In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an antihero . 64 Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name characters distinctive visual style and although a non-smoker Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the mask he was attempting to create for the character. 65 A Fistful of Dollars proved a landmark in the development of spaghetti Westerns with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The films success made Eastwood a major star in Italy 66 and he was rehired to star in For a Few Dollars More 1965 the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the trilogys final film The Good the Bad and the Ugly 1966 were sold to United Artists for about 900 000. 67 In January 1966 Eastwood met producer Dino De Laurentiis in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production The Witches Le Streghe 1967 opposite De Laurentiiss wife Silvana Mangano . 68 Eastwoods 19-minute installment took only a few days to shoot but his performance did not please critics; one wrote no other performance of his is quite so un-Clintlike . 69 Two months later Eastwood began work on The Good the Bad and the Ugly again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker with Eli Wallach portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. I know about these things he said. Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can. 70 Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word Vaya! resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach. 70 I wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement. It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past. It came about after the frustration of doing Rawhide for so long. I felt the less he said the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience. Eastwood on playing the Man with No Name character 71 As the Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars 1964 The Dollars trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967 when A Fistful of Dollars opened on January 18 followed by For a Few Dollars More on May 10 and The Good the Bad and the Ugly on December 29. 72 All three were commercially successful particularly The Good the Bad and the Ugly which eventually earned 8 million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star being ranked for the first time on Quigleys Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in 1968 in fifth place. 72 73 All three received poor reviews and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics respect. 74 Judith Crist described A Fistful of Dollars as cheapjack 75 while Newsweek called For a Few Dollars More excruciatingly dopey . Renata Adler of The New York Times said The Good the Bad and the Ugly was the most expensive pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre . 76 Time magazine drew attention to the films wooden acting especially Eastwoods though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised his coolness. 77 Leones cinematography was widely acclaimed even by critics who disparaged the acting. 74 Stardom brought Eastwood more roles. He signed to star in the American revisionist western Hang Em High 1968 alongside Inger Stevens Pat Hingle Ed Begley 78 playing a man who takes up a marshal s badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead. 79 The film earned Eastwood 400 000 and 25 of its net box office. 78 Using money earned from the Dollars trilogy Eastwoods advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwoods own production company Malpaso Productions named after Malpaso Creek on Eastwoods property in Monterey County California . The 38-year-old actor was still relatively unknown as late as a month prior to the films release as evidenced by a July 1968 news item by syndicated columnist Dorothy Manners: The proverbial man in the street is still asking Whos Clint Eastwood? 80 Leonard arranged for Hang Em High to be a joint production with United Artists; 81 when it opened in August it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists history. Hang Em High was widely praised by critics including Archer Winsten of the New York Post who called it a western of quality courage danger and excitement . 17 Before Hang Em High s release Eastwood had already begun working on Coogans Bluff 1968 about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal Don Stroud through New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of 1 million more than double his previous salary. 82 Jennings Lang arranged for Eastwood to meet Don Siegel a Universal contract director who later became Eastwoods close friend forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films. 83 Shooting began in November 1967 before the script had been finalized. 84 The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence. 85 86 Coogans Bluff also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin who scored several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s including the Dirty Harry films. 87 Eastwood was paid 750 000 for the war epic Where Eagles Dare 1968 88 about a World War II squad parachuting into a Gestapo stronghold in the Alps . Richard Burton played the squads commander with Eastwood as his right-hand man. Eastwood was also cast as Two-Face in the Batman television show but the series was canceled before filming began. 89 Eastwood then branched out to star in the only musical of his career Paint Your Wagon 1969. Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settlers less favored wife Jean Seberg at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production and the films budget eventually exceeded 20 million which was high for the time. 90 The film was not a critical or commercial success but was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . 91 19701989: directorial debut and Dirty Harry Eastwood starred with Shirley MacLaine in the western Two Mules for Sister Sara 1970 directed by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary who becomes mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels during the reign of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico . 92 93 Eastwood again played a mysterious stranger unshaven wearing a serape-like vest and smoking a cigar. 94 Although it received moderate reviews 95 96 97 the film is listed in The New York Times Guide to the Best 1 000 Movies Ever Made . 98 Around the same time Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steals a fortune in gold from the Nazis in the World War II film Kellys Heroes also 1970 with Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas . Kellys Heroes was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions. 99 Shot on location in Yugoslavia and London 100 the film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized. 99 Siegel directed Eastwoods next film The Beguiled 1971 a tale of a wounded Union soldier held captive by the sexually repressed matron played by Geraldine Page of a Southern girls school. 101 Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwoods finest works by French critics. 102 However it grossed less than 1 million and according to Eastwood and Lang flopped due to poor publicity and the emasculated role of Eastwood. 103 A mural in Warsaw Poland referring to Eastwoods Dirty Harry character with a quote in English and Esperanto Eastwoods career reached a turning point in 1971. 104 Before Irving Leonard died he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing Play Misty for Me a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired and his debut as a director. 105 The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave Eastwood who has a casual affair with Evelyn Jessica Walter a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night asking him to play her favorite song Erroll Garner s Misty . When Dave ends their relationship the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker. 106 Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that years Monterey Jazz Festival . 107 The film was highly acclaimed with critics such as Jay Cocks in Time magazine Andrew Sarris in the Village Voice and Archer Winsten in the New York Post all praising the film as well as Eastwoods directorial skills and performance. 108 Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award Drama for her performance in the film. 109 I know what youre thinking Did he fire six shots or only five? Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement Ive kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off youve got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well do you punk? Eastwood in Dirty Harry Dirty Harry 1971 written by Harry and Rita Fink centers on a hard-edged New York City later changed to San Francisco police inspector named Harry Callahan who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means. 110 Dirty Harry has been described as being arguably Eastwoods most memorable character and the film has been credited with inventing the loose-cannon cop genre. 111 112 Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwoods role as Dirty Harry established the first true archetype of the action film genre. 113 His lines quoted above are regarded by firearms historians such as Garry James and Richard Venola as the force that catapulted the ownership of .44 Magnum revolvers to new heights in the United States; specifically the Smith Wesson Model 29 carried by Harry Callahan. 114 115 Dirty Harry released in December 1971 earned 22 million in the United States and Canada. 116 It was Siegels highest-grossing film and the start of a series of films featuring the character Harry Callahan. Although a number of critics praised Eastwoods performance as Dirty Harry such as Jay Cocks who described him as giving his best performance so far tense tough full of implicit identification with his character 117 the film was also widely criticized as being fascistic . 118 119 120 After having been second for the past two years Eastwood was voted first in Quigleys Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in 1972 and again in 1973. 121 Following Sean Connery s announcement that he would not play James Bond again Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down saying that was someone elses gig. Thats Seans deal. It didnt feel right for me to be doing it. 122 He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd 1972 based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla New Mexico in June 1967. During filming Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. 123 Joe Kidd received a mixed reception with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was unremarkable with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing although he praised Eastwoods performance. 124 Eastwoods first western as director was High Plains Drifter 1973 in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme later emulated in Pale Rider . The plot follows a mysterious stranger Eastwood who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy whom the felons lynched and murdered or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and allegory influenced by Leone. 125 The revisionist film received a mixed reception but was a major box-office success. A number of critics thought Eastwoods directing was as derivative as it was expressive with Arthur Knight of the Saturday Review remarking that Eastwood had absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society . 126 John Wayne who had declined a role in the film sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the films release in which he complained that The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer the spirit that made America great. 127 Directing William Holden in Breezy 1972 Eastwood next turned his attention towards Breezy 1973 a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and become an important figure in his life. 128 Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke at 29 was nearly twice the characters age. c The film shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley came in 1 million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. 132 Breezy was not a major critical or commercial success. 10 Once filming of Breezy had finished Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in Magnum Force 1973 a sequel to Dirty Harry about a group of rogue young officers among them David Soul Robert Urich and Tim Matheson in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the citys worst criminals. 133 Although the film was a major success after release grossing 58.1 million in the United States a record for Eastwood it was not a critical success. 134 135 The New York Times critic Nora Sayre panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film while the papers Frank Rich called it the same old stuff . 135 Eastwood teamed up with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper Thunderbolt and Lightfoot 1974 a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt Eastwood and a young con man drifter Lightfoot Bridges. On its release in spring 1974 the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office earning 32.4 million. 136 Eastwoods acting was noted by critics but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again. 136 137 At a film shoot for The Eiger Sanction 1974 Eastwoods next film The Eiger Sanction 1975 was based on Trevanian s critically acclaimed spy novel of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for Paul Newman an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last sanction in return for a rare Pissarro painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the Eiger in Switzerland under perilous conditions. Mike Hoover taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at Yosemite in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in Grindelwald Switzerland on August 12. 138 139 Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. The film crew suffered a number of accidents including one fatality. 140 141 Upon release in May 1975 The Eiger Sanction was marginally successful commercially receiving 14.2 million at the box-office and gained mixed reviews. 142 Joy Gould Boyum of The Wall Street Journal dismissed the film as brutal fantasy . 142 143 Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the films poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with Warner Brothers through Frank Wells that has lasted to the present day. 144 Chief Dan George with Locke and Eastwood at a barbecue in Santa Fe New Mexico promoting The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976 The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976 a western inspired by Asa Carter s 1972 novel of the same name 145 has lead character Josey Wales Eastwood as a pro-Confederate guerrilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the American Civil War and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. The supporting cast included Locke as his love interest and Chief Dan George as an elderly Cherokee who strikes up a friendship with Wales. Director Philip Kaufman was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwoods command in October 1975 three weeks into the shoot resulting in a fine reported to be around 60 000 from the Directors Guild of America who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director. 146 The film was pre-screened at the Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities in Idaho during a six-day conference entitled Western Movies: Myths and Images . Invited to the screening were a number of esteemed film critics including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight; directors such as King Vidor William Wyler and Howard Hawks ; and a number of academics. 147 Upon release in the summer of 1976 The Outlaw Josey Wales was widely acclaimed with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwoods role as an iconic one that related to Americas ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War. 147 Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwoods portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the Dollars westerns and praised the films atmosphere. 148 The film would later appear in Time s Top 10 Films of the Year . 149 Eastwood was then offered the role of Benjamin L. Willard in Francis Coppolas Apocalypse Now but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the Philippines. 150 151 He also refused the part of a platoon leader in Ted Post s Vietnam War film Go Tell the Spartans 150 and instead decided to make a third Dirty Harry film The Enforcer 1976. The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer Tyne Daly to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the Symbionese Liberation Army . The film culminating in a shootout on Alcatraz island was considerably shorter than the previous Dirty Harry films at 95 minutes 152 but was a major commercial success grossing 100 million worldwide to become Eastwoods highest-grossing film to date. 153 Eastwood and Locke in The Gauntlet 1977 Eastwood directed and starred in The Gauntlet 1977 opposite Locke Pat Hingle William Prince Bill McKinney and Mara Corday . In this film he portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the mob . Although a moderate hit with the viewing public critics had mixed feelings about the film with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert in contrast gave the film three stars and called it classic Clint Eastwood: fast furious and funny . 154 In Every Which Way but Loose 1978 he had an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. His character Philo Beddoe is a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love Locke accompanied by his best friend Orville Boggs played by Geoffrey Lewis and an orangutan called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwoods most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics it ranked high among the box-office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978. 155 Eastwood starred in Escape from Alcatraz 1979 the last of his films directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of Frank Lee Morris who along with John and Clarence Anglin escaped from the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in 1962.

Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that film was the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while and praised Eastwoods directing intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West. 162 Released later in 1980 Any Which Way You Can was the sequel to Every Which Way but Loose and also starring Eastwood. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics although Maslin described it as funnier and even better than its predecessor . 161 In theaters over the Christmas season Any Which Way You Can was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year. 163 Eastwood in 1981 Eastwood directed and starred in Honkytonk Man 1982 based on the eponymous Clancy Carlile s depression -era novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from tuberculosis but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the Grand Ole Opry . He is accompanied by his young nephew played by real-life son Kyle to Nashville Tennessee where he is supposed to record a song. Only Time gave the film a good review in the United States with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy. 164 Nevertheless the film received a more positive reception in France where it was compared to John Ford s The Grapes of Wrath 165 and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. 166 Around the same time Eastwood directed produced and starred in the Cold War -themed Firefox also 1982. Based on a 1977 novel with the same name written by Craig Thomas the film was shot before but released after Honkytonk Man . Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War and the film had to be shot in Vienna and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of 20 million it was Eastwoods highest budget film to that time. 167 People magazine likened Eastwoods performance to Luke Skywalker trapped in Dirty Harrys Soul . 167 Eastwood directed and starred in the fourth Dirty Harry film Sudden Impact 1983 which is considered the darkest and most violent of the series. 168 By this time Eastwood received 60 percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed with the rest going to the studio. 169 Sudden Impact was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays a middle-aged painter who along with her sister was gang-raped years before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sisters now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line Go ahead make my day uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop has been cited as one of cinemas immortal lines. It was quoted by President Ronald Reagan in a speech to Congress and used during the 1984 presidential elections . 170 171 172 The film was the second most commercially successful of the Dirty Harry films after The Enforcer earning 70 million. It received very positive reviews with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape. 173 Tightrope 1984 had Eastwood starring opposite Genevieve Bujold in a provocative thriller inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films 174 Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his targets tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism . 175 Tightrope was a critical and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. 176 Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat also 1984 alongside Burt Reynolds a film about an ex-cop turned private eye and his former police lieutenant partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the Prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around 50 million domestically but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy s Beverly Hills Cop . 177 Eastwood and Locke at the premiere of City Heat 1984 with Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson Westerns. A period gone by the pioneer the loner operating by himself without benefit of society. It usually has something to do with some sort of vengeance; he takes care of the vengeance himself doesnt call the police. Like Robin Hood. Its the last masculine frontier. Romantic myth I guess though its hard to think about anything romantic today. In a Western you can think Jesus there was a time when man was alone on horseback out there where man hasnt spoiled the land yet. Eastwood on the philosophical allure of portraying western loners 178 Eastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the Amazing Stories episode Vanessa in the Garden 1985 which starred Harvey Keitel and Locke as a married couple. This was his first collaboration with Steven Spielberg who later co-produced Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima . 179 He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in Pale Rider 1985 a film based on the classic western Shane 1953 and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the California Gold Rush of 1850. 180 The title is a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as the rider of the pale horse is Death and shows similarities to Eastwoods western High Plains Drifter 1973 in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural. 181 It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period with Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune remarking This year 1985 will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist. 182 Eastwood co-starred with Marsha Mason in the military drama Heartbreak Ridge 1986 about the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada . He portrayed a United States Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant veteran of the Vietnam War who realizes he is nearing the end of his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes as well as between Eastwood and the United States Department of Defense which had expressed contempt for the film. 183 184 At the time the film was a commercial rather than a critical success and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times. 185 The film grossed 70 million domestically. 186 Eastwood starred in The Dead Pool 1988 the fifth and final film in the Dirty Harry series. It co-starred Patricia Clarkson Liam Neeson and a young Jim Carrey who plays Johnny Squares a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan Neeson who are deemed most likely to die the so-called Dead Pool . The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who in mimicking his favorite director makes his way through the list killing off celebrities of which Dirty Harry is also included. The Dead Pool grossed nearly 38 million relatively low receipts for a Dirty Harry film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original. 187 188 Eastwood began working on smaller more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz he directed Bird 1988 a biopic starring Forest Whitaker as jazz musician Charlie Bird Parker . Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and Spike Lee son of jazz bassist Bill Lee and a long time critic of Eastwood criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor. 189 Eastwood received two Golden Globes for the film the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his lifelong contribution and the Best Director award . However Bird was a commercial failure earning just 11 million which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people. 190 Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly-received comedy Pink Cadillac 1989. The film is about a bounty hunter and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman Bernadette Peters who tries to outrun everyone in her husbands prized pink Cadillac . The film failed both critically and commercially 191 earning barely more than Bird and marking a low point in Eastwoods career. 192 19902009: critical acclaim and awards success Eastwood directed and starred in White Hunter Black Heart 1990 an adaptation of Peter Viertel s roman a clef about John Huston and the making of the classic film The African Queen . Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989 193 the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just 8.4 million. 194 Eastwood directed and co-starred with Charlie Sheen in The Rookie a buddy cop action film released in December 1990. Critics found the films plot and characterization unconvincing but praised its action sequences. 195 An ongoing lawsuit in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a womans car 196 resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. 197 Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainants legal fees if she did not appeal. 197 If possible he looks even taller leaner and more mysteriously possessed than he did in Sergio Leones seminal Fistful of Dollars a quarter of a century ago. The years havent softened him. They have given him the presence of some fierce force of nature which may be why the landscapes of the mythic late 19th-century West become him never more so than in his new Unforgiven . ... This is his richest most satisfying performance since the underrated politically lunatic Heartbreak Ridge . Theres no one like him. Vincent Canby of The New York Times on Eastwoods performance in Unforgiven 198 Eastwood revisited the western genre in Unforgiven 1992 a film which he directed and starred in as an aging ex- gunfighter long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as The Cut-Whore Killings and The William Munny Killings but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films. 197 Unforgiven was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the Los Angeles Times described it as the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Fords 1956 The Searchers . 199 The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards 200 including Best Actor for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for David Webb Peoples and won four including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. In June 2008 Unforgiven was ranked as the fourth-best American western behind Shane High Noon and The Searchers in the American Film Institute s AFIs 10 Top 10 list. 201 202 Eastwood at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival Eastwood played Frank Horrigan in the Secret Service thriller In the Line of Fire 1993 directed by Wolfgang Petersen and co-starring John Malkovich and Rene Russo . Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by his failure to save John F. Kennedy s life. 203 The film was among the top 10 box office performers in that year earning 102 million in the United States alone and 25 years after he was first listed on Quigleys Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll Eastwood was voted number one again. 204 73 A few months after film wrapped Eastwood directed and co-starred alongside Kevin Costner in A Perfect World also 1993. Set in the 1960s 205 Eastwood plays a Texas Ranger in pursuit of an escaped convict Costner who hits the road with a young boy T.J. Lowther .

Thalberg Memorial Award at the 67th Academy Awards . 210 His next film appearance was in a cameo role as himself in the childrens film Casper 1995.

Despite the novel receiving unfavorable reviews The Bridges of Madison County film was a commercial and critical success. 212 Roger Ebert wrote Streep and Eastwood weave a spell and it is based on that particular knowledge of love and self that comes with middle age. 213 The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Picture and won a Cesar Award in France for Best Foreign Film. Streep was also nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Eastwood directed and starred in the political thriller Absolute Power 1997 alongside Gene Hackman with whom he had appeared in Unforgiven .

The film received a mixed reception from critics. 214 Later in 1997 Eastwood directed Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil based on the novel by John Berendt and starring John Cusack Kevin Spacey and Jude Law . The film met with a mixed critical response. 215 The roles that Eastwood has played and the films that he has directed cannot be disentangled from the nature of the American culture of the last quarter century its fantasies and its realities. Author Edward Gallafent commenting on Eastwoods impact on film from the 1970s to 1990s 216 Eastwood directed and starred in True Crime 1999. He plays Steve Everett a journalist and recovering alcoholic who has to cover the execution of murderer Frank Beechum played by Isaiah Washington . True Crime received a mixed reception with Janet Maslin of The New York Times writing his direction is galvanized by a sense of second chances and tragic misunderstandings and by contrasting a larger sense of justice with the peculiar minutiae of crime. Perhaps he goes a shade too far in the latter direction though. 217 The film was a box office failure earning less than half its 55 million budget and was Eastwoods worst-performing film of the 1990s aside from White Hunter Black Heart which had a limited release. 218 Eastwood directed and starred in Space Cowboys 2000 alongside Tommy Lee Jones Donald Sutherland and James Garner .

He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. The New Yorker s David Denby wrote that unlike Eastwood 280 John Ford appeared in just a few silent films; Howard Hawks never acted in movies. Clark Gable Gary Cooper Spencer Tracy James Stewart Cary Grant Humphrey Bogart William Holden Steve McQueen and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman Jack Nicholson Warren Beatty Robert Redford Robert De Niro and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each with mixed commercial and artistic success. From the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected and when he began directing in 1970 he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take. 281 282 Eastwoods rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of Woody Allen Ingmar Bergman and Jean-Luc Godard . by whom? When acting in others films he sometimes takes over directing such as for The Outlaw Josey Wales if he believes production is too slow. 280 In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses storyboards for developing the layout of a shooting schedule. 283 284 285 He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film 286 considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers. 286 287 Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a films plot to provide the audience with necessary details but not so much that it insults their intelligence . 288 According to Life magazine Eastwoods style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic. 289 Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter commented that Eastwoods films are superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and give a strong sense of real time regardless of the speed of the narrative 290 while Ric Gentry considers Eastwoods pacing unrushed and relaxed . 291 Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his films a noir-ish feel. 282 292 Eastwoods frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars who have explored Eastwoods work from ethical and theological perspectives including his portrayal of justice mercy suicide and the angel of death. 293 Politics Main article: Political life of Clint Eastwood Eastwood with President Ronald Reagan in July 1987 Eastwood is a former Republican who has sometimes supported Democrats and has long shown an interest in California politics ; he is currently a registered Libertarian . 294 He won election as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea California in April 1986.

I can protect myself but they cant. 313 His biographer Patrick McGilligan has stated on camera that Eastwoods total number of children is indeterminate and that one was when he was still in high school . 314 Eastwoods first marriage was to manufacturing secretary-turned-fitness instructor Margaret Neville Johnson in December 1953 having met her on a blind date the previous May. 315 During the courtship he had an affair that resulted in his daughter Laurie born 1954 who was adopted by Clyde and Helen Warren of Seattle. 316 317 318 319 320 While the identity of Lauries biological mother is not public record 309 McGilligan said the mother belonged to a theatre group Eastwood participated in. d Eastwood continued having affairs while married to Johnson including a 1959 to 1973 liaison with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter Kimber born 1964. 322 323 Tunis and Eastwood would keep up a healthy relationship until her death in 2023. 324 Johnson tolerated the open marriage with Eastwood 325 326 and eventually they had two children Kyle born 1968 and Alison born 1972. 309 In 1975 Eastwood and married actress-director Sondra Locke began living together; 327 she had been in a marriage of convenience since 1967 with Gordon Leigh Anderson an unemployed homosexual. 328 329 330 Locke claimed that Eastwood sang She Made Me Monogamous to her 323 331 and confided he had never been in love before . 22 332 Eastwood finally divorced Johnson in 1984; 333 Locke however would remain married to Anderson until her death in 2018. 334 According to Bill Brown publisher of the Carmel Pine Cone Eastwood considered Locke the love of his life 335 yet he has never addressed her death. 336 In an unpublicized affair Eastwood sired two legally fatherless 22 337 338 339 children Scott born 1986 and Kathryn born 1988 with Jacelyn Reeves a flight attendant. 340 When Locke and Eastwood separated in 1989 Locke filed a palimony lawsuit and later sued for fraud 341 reaching a settlement in both cases. 328 During the early-to-mid-1990s Eastwood had a relationship with actress Frances Fisher that produced a daughter Francesca born 1993. 342 Eastwood was married for the second time in 1996 to news anchor Dina Ruiz who gave birth to their daughter Morgan that same year. 343 Ruiz and Eastwoods marriage lasted until 2014. 309 Beginning 2014 Eastwood was seen in company with restaurant hostess Christina Sandera 344 though neither publicly confirmed a romance. 345 346 Eastwoods spokespeople managers and press agents have long denied any knowledge of his life. 347 348 Sandera died of a heart attack in July 2024 aged 61. 349 Health and leisure activities The Hogs Breath Inn in Carmel once owned by Eastwood Eastwood has been a health and fitness fanatic since he was a teenager. During the production of Rawhide Eastwood featured in magazines and journals which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In an August 1959 edition of TV Guide for example Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables take vitamins and avoid sugar-loaded beverages excessive alcohol and overloading on carbohydrates. 350 Eastwoods fathers death from a heart attack at the age of 64 in 1970 described by Fritz Manes as the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life 105 came as a shock to Eastwood since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on his life; from then on he became more productive working with greater speed and efficiency on set and adopted an even more rigorous health regimen. 106 Despite abstaining from hard liquor he opened an old English-inspired pub called the Hogs Breath Inn in Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1971. 351 Eastwood eventually sold the pub in 1999 and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea. 350 352 353 354 Eastwood playing golf at a charity fundraising event in 2015 Eastwood is an avid golfer and owns the Tehama Golf Club . He is an investor in the world-renowned Pebble Beach Golf Links west of Carmel and donates his time to charitable causes at major tournaments. 305 355 356 Eastwood is an FAA licensed fixed wing and rotary craft private pilot and often flies his helicopter to the studios to avoid traffic. 357 358 Spiritual beliefs and meditation In 1973 Eastwood told the film critic Gene Siskel No I dont believe in God . 359 In 2023 his daughter Kathryn stated Most of my earthly family do not believe in or worship God. They either have a lack of faith or reject the god in the Bible in favor of other idols or ideas. 360 Eastwood has said that he finds spirituality in nature as suggested by his Western Pale Rider 1985 stating that I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were Protestant but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if thats something you like. So although my religious training was not really specific I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down it moves me in some way. 361 He has also said: It would be wonderful to talk with my parents again who are of course deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again if you think that nothing happens after you die maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe youre supposed to do the best you can by the gift youre given of life and that alone. 361 In 1975 Eastwood publicly proclaimed his participation in Transcendental Meditation when he appeared on The Merv Griffin Show with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi the founder of Transcendental Meditation. 352 He has meditated every morning for years. 362 Real estate interests While serving in the US Army at nearby Fort Ord Eastwood developed an interest in Carmel area real estate. With income from his acting career on December 24 1967 he bought five parcels totaling 283 acres 115 ha of land from Charles Sawyer along Highway 1 near Malpaso Creek south of the Carmel Highlands . 363 In May 1968 Eastwood and actor James Garner bought 340 acres 138 ha of wooded land in Carmel Valley from the Howard Hattan estate for 640 000. The property was across the Carmel Valley Road from the Rancho Canada Country Club and golf course. 364 Eastwood and Garner donated the undeveloped property to the Housing Authority of the County of Monterey in November 1983 with the stipulation that some of the land be used for senior housing. 365 He named his production company Malpaso Productions. 366 367 Eastwood later bought another parcel in the Highlands together totaling 650 acres 263 ha 6 parcels. In 1995 Monterey County bought the Malpaso land from him for 3.08 million and placed a permanent conservation easement on the property. 368 369 Using the proceeds from the sale Eastwood bought the 134 acres 54 ha Odello Ranch at the mouth of the Carmel River during the same year. He paid to lower the levees along the southern side of the Carmel River to protect the Mission Ranch resort he owned along with the neighboring Mission Fields residential neighborhood on the north side of the river both of which were flooded in 1994. 368 In 1997 Eastwood and his former wife Maggie Johnson acting as the Eastwood Trust donated 49 acres 20 ha of the Odello Ranch property east of Highway 1 to the Big Sur Land Trust along with the associated water rights. 370 On June 28 2016 Eastwood finally donated the remaining Odello East land. 371 Eastwood purchased 550 acres 223 ha known as the Canada Woods development immediately east of the Odello Ranch. 368 In 2010 at age 80 Eastwood spent approximately 20 million 372 to build himself a 15 949-square-foot compound in Carmel-by-the-Sea. 373 374 His California real estate portfolio also includes a 6 136-square-foot Spanish-style mansion in Bel-Air 375 376 the 1 067.5 acre Rising River Ranch near Cassel 377 an apartment in Burbank 378 a 5 575-square-foot Desert modern home in La Quinta 379 sometimes misidentified as Palm Springs 380 as well as a large but understated 381 house located next door to his longtime primary Bel-Air residence. 382 383 Eastwood is known to have purchased property in two other states.

Ruths birth name was Margret as in Ann-Margret not Margaret as in Margaret Thatcher . This according to state birth records. 9 Lockes age was misstated in 50 years worth of publications including every Eastwood biography on the market; it was not until after her death that the media consistently acknowledged she was born in 1944. 129 130 131 In a December 2018 interview Eastwoods grandson Lowell Thomas Murray IV said his yet-to-be-identified maternal grandmother never told Eastwood she was pregnant or spoke to him again.
