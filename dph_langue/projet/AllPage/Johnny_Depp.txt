They were the opposite of the Beverly Hills 90210 boys or Brad Pitt and DiCaprio because they seemed embarrassed by their looks even resentful of them. ...This uninterest in their own prettiness made them seem edgy even while their prettiness softened that edge. They signified not just a different kind of celebrity but a different kind of masculinity: desirable but gentle manly but girlish. Depp in particular was the cool pinup it was safe to like and the safe pinup it was cool to like. We fans understood that there was more to Depp Phoenix and Reeves than handsomeness. They were artisticthey had bands!and they thought really big thoughts which they would ramble on about confusingly in interviews. If we dated them we understood that our role would be to understand their souls. 241 Similarly film scholar Anna Everett has described Depps 1990s films and public persona as anti-macho and gender-bending going against the conventions of a Hollywood leading man. 242 After 21 Jump Street Depp chose to work in independent films often taking on quirky roles that sometimes even completely obscured his looks such as Edward Scissorhands . 241 242 Critics often described Depps characters as iconic loners 40 or gentle outsiders . 242 According to Depp his onetime agent Tracey Jacobs of United Talent Agency UTA had to take a lot of heat over the years for his role choices; Depp characterized higher-ups at UTA as thinking Jesus Christ! When does he do a movie where he kisses the girl? When does he get to pull a gun out and shoot somebody? When does he get to be a man for a change? When is he finally going to do a blockbuster? . 246 According to Everett his rule-breaking roles matched with the much publicized rebelliousness unconventionality and volatility ascribed to Depps own personal life throughout the decade. From reports of his repeated confrontations with the police trashing of a hotel room chain smoking drinking and drug use to his multiple engagements to such glamorous women as supermodel Kate Moss and Hollywood starlet Winona Ryder and others we clearly see a perfect fit between his non-conformist star image and his repertoire of outsider characters . 242 Depp with producer Jerry Bruckheimer center and actor Tom Cruise right in 2013 After a decade of appearing mainly in independent films with varying commercial success Depp became one of the biggest box-office draws in the 2000s with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Walt Disney Studios Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 247 The five films in the series have earned US4.5 billion as of 2021. In addition to the Pirates franchise Depp also made four further films with Tim Burton that were major successes with one Alice in Wonderland 2010 becoming the biggest commercial hit of Depps career and one of the highest-grossing films in history as of 2021. 248 In 2012 Depp was one of the worlds biggest film stars 106 107 and was listed by the Guinness World Records as the worlds highest-paid actor with earnings of US75 million in a year. 108 According to film scholar Murray Pomerance Depps collaboration with Disney can be seen to purport and herald a new era for Johnny Depp one in which he is finally as though long-promised and long-expected the proud proprietor of a much-accepted career; not only a star but a middle-class hero . 247 In 2003 the same year as the first film in the Pirates series was released Depp was named Worlds Sexiest Man by People ; he would receive the title again in 2009. 247 During the decade and into the 2010s Depp was one of the biggest and most popular film stars in the world 106 107 and was named by public vote as Favorite Male Movie Star at the Peoples Choice Awards every year for 2005 through 2012. In 2012 Depp became the highest-paid actor in the American film industry earning as high as 75 million per film 108 and as of 2020 is the tenth highest-grossing actor worldwide with his films having grossed over US3.7 billion at the United States box office and over US10 billion worldwide. 249 Although a mainstream favorite with the audiences critics views on Depp changed in the 2000s becoming more negative as he was seen to conform more to the Hollywood ideal. 247 Regardless Depp continued to eschew more traditional leading-man roles until towards the end of the 2000s when he starred as John Dillinger in Public Enemies 2009. 247 In the 2010s Depps films were less successful with many big-budget studio films such as Dark Shadows 2012 The Lone Ranger 2013 and Alice Through the Looking Glass 2016 underperforming at the box office. 113 111 116 117 Depp also received negative publicity due to allegations of domestic violence substance abuse poor on-set behavior and the loss of his US650 million fortune. 250 251 252 253 241 After losing a highly publicized libel trial against the publishers of The Sun Depp was asked to resign from Warner Bros. Fantastic Beasts franchise. 156 Many publications alleged that Depp would struggle to find further work in major studio productions in the future. 254 241 255 Personal life Depp owns a property in West Hollywood and currently lives in London. By February 2023 he had not yet bought a property there instead choosing to either stay at hotels or at friends houses. 256 Relationships Depp and makeup artist Lori Anne Allison were married from 1983 until 1985. 257 In the late 1980s he was engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn . 241 In 1990 he proposed to his Edward Scissorhands co-star Winona Ryder whom he had begun dating the year prior when she was 17 and he was 26. 258 259 They ended their relationship in 1993; 258 Depp later had the Winona Forever tattoo on his right arm changed to Wino Forever . 241 Between 1994 and 1998 he was in a relationship with English model Kate Moss . 260 Following his breakup with Moss Depp began a relationship with French actress and singer Vanessa Paradis whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate in France in 1998. They have two children daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp born 1999 and a son Jack born 2002. 261 Depp stated that having children has given him a real foundation a real strong place to stand in life in work in everything ...You cannot plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny. All the math finally worked. 70 In June 2012 Depp and Paradis announced their separation. 262 Following the end of his relationship with Vanessa Paradis Depp began dating actress Amber Heard with whom he had co-starred in The Rum Diary 2011. 263 Depp and Heard were married in a civil ceremony on February 3 2015. 264 265 266 Heard filed for divorce on May 23 2016 and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp alleging in her court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 267 268 269 253 Depp denied these claims and alleged that she was attempting to secure a premature financial resolution . 270 267 271 A settlement was reached in August 2016 272 and the divorce was finalized in January 2017. 273 Heard dismissed the restraining order and they issued a joint statement saying that their relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm . 272 Depp paid Heard a divorce settlement of US7 million which she pledged to donate 274 to the ACLU 275 and the Childrens Hospital Los Angeles CHLA. 276 277 Legal issues and allegations Heard related litigations Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd Main article: Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd In 2018 278 Depp brought a libel lawsuit in the UK against News Group Newspapers NGN publishers of The Sun over an April 2018 article titled GONE POTTY How Can J K Rowling be genuinely happy casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film? . 279 280 281 The case had a highly publicized trial in July 2020 with both Depp and Heard testifying for several days. 282 Depps lawyer David Sherborne said that Heard had blatantly lied in her evidence while NGNs lawyer Sasha Wass said that all the evidence in the case and all the supporting evidence of the incidents of violence leave no doubt that Mr. Depp regularly and systematically abused his wife . 283 In November 2020 the High Court of Justice ruled that 12 of the 14 incidents of physical violence alleged by NGN occurred and that in three of them Depp had put Heard in fear of her life . 280 281 The court rejected Depps claim of a hoax as well as his characterization of Heard as a gold-digger . 284 On the other hand the court found that the characterization of Depp as a wife beater by The Sun was substantially true . 280 281 Following the verdict Depp resigned from the Fantastic Beasts franchise after being asked to do so by its production company Warner Bros. 158 Depp appealed the verdict with his lawyers accusing Heard of not following through on a pledge to donate her divorce settlement to charity contrary to her testimony. Depps lawyers also asserted that Heards donation testimony had significantly influenced the judges view of Heard. 285 In response Heards legal team stated that she had not yet finished paying her pledged donation due to the financial burden of the lawsuits against her by Depp and that Depp was using this to divert attention from the UK Courts findings relating to allegations of Mr. Depp committing domestic abuse and violence . 285 286 Depps appeal to overturn the verdict was rejected by the England and Wales Court of Appeal in March 2021 287 with the Court concluding: 288 289 We do not accept that there is any ground for believing that the judge may have been influenced by any such general perception as Depps lawyer relies on. In the first place he does not refer to Heards charitable donation at all in the context of his central findings. On the contrary he only mentions it in a very particular context... and after he had already reached his conclusions in relation to the 14 incidents... It is clear from a reading of the judgment as a whole that the judge based his conclusions on each of the incidents on his extremely detailed review of the evidence specific to each incident. ... In an approach of that kind there was little need or room for the judge to give weight to any general assessment of Ms. Heards credibility... we conclude that the appeal has no real prospect of success. Depp v. Heard Main article: Depp v. Heard In February 2019 Depp sued Heard for defamation over a December 2018 op-ed for The Washington Post . 290 291 292 The lawsuit ultimately resulted in Depp alleging that the op-ed contained three defamatory statements: first its headline Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence and faced our cultures wrath. That has to change ; second Heards writing: Then two years ago I became a public figure representing domestic abuse and I felt the full force of our cultures wrath for women who speak out ; and third Heards writing: I had the rare vantage point of seeing in real time how institutions protect men accused of abuse. 293 294 Depp alleged that he had been the one who was abused by Heard that her allegations constituted a hoax against him and that as a consequence Disney had declined to cast him in future projects. 290 292 Heard countersued Depp in August 2020 alleging that he had coordinated a harassment campaign via Twitter and by orchestrating online petitions in an effort to get her fired from Aquaman and LOreal . 295 296 Ultimately Heards counter-suit went to trial over three allegations that Depp had defamed her through statements made by his then-lawyer Adam Waldman published in the Daily Mail in April 2020: first Waldman stated that Heard and her friends in the media used fake sexual violence allegations as both sword and shield publicizing a sexual violence hoax against Depp; second Waldman stated that in one incident at a penthouse Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up got their stories straight under the direction of a lawyer and publicist and then placed a second call to 911 as a hoax against Depp; third Waldman stated that there had been an abuse hoax by Heard against Depp. 293 297 In October 2020 the judge in the case dismissed Depps lawyer Adam Waldman after he leaked confidential information covered by a protective order to the media. 254 298 Following the verdict in Depps lawsuit against The Sun the next month Heards lawyers filed to have the defamation suit dismissed but Judge Penny Azcarate ruled against it because Heard had not been a party in the UK case. 299 In August 2021 a New York judge ruled that the ACLU must disclose documents related to Heards charity pledge to the organization. 300 301 The Depp v. Heard trial took place in Fairfax County Virginia from April 11 to June 1 2022. During the trial Heard accused Depp of domestic abuse stating that Depp plunged into the depths of paranoia and violence after binging on drugs and alcohol during their relationship. On the other hand Depp accused Heard of several instances of physical and verbal abuse during their relationship. 253 302 272 303 On June 1 2022 the jury returned a verdict after 13 hours of deliberation. In their verdict the jury found that all three statements from Heards op-ed were false defamed Depp and were made with actual malice . The jury awarded Depp 10 million in compensatory damages and 5 million in punitive damages 293 297 although the punitive damages were reduced to 350 000 due to a limit imposed by an existing Virginia state law. 304 For Heards counter-suit the jury found that Waldmans first and third statements to the Daily Mail were not defamatory while finding that Waldmans second statement to the Daily Mail was false defamatory and made with actual malice. 297 As a result Heard was awarded 2 million in compensatory damages and zero in punitive damages from Depp. 293 Depp reacted to the result of the trial by declaring that the jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled. 305 Depp also stated that he was overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the colossal support and kindness from around the world . He continued: I hope that my quest to have the truth be told will have helped others men or women who have found themselves in my situation and that those supporting them never give up. 306 Depp also highlighted the noble work of the Judge the jurors the court staff and the Sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to get to this point and praised his diligent and unwavering legal team for an extraordinary job . 307 After they filed to appeal the verdict Heard and Depp settled the case in December 2022 with Heard maintaining that the settlement was not an act of concession ; meanwhile Depps lawyers stated that the jurys unanimous decision and the resulting judgement in Mr. Depps favor against Ms. Heard remain fully in place and that the settlement would result in 1 million being paid to Depp which Depp is pledging and will donate to charities . 308 309 Other legal issues and allegations Depp was arrested in Vancouver in 1989 for assaulting a security guard after the police were called to end a loud party at his hotel room. 310 When later asked about the incident in 1991 Depp stated: The guy had a boner for me... He had a wild hair up his ass and he got real mouthy with me saying I know who you are but you cant come up unless youre a guest here. The mistake he eventually made was to put his hands on me. I pushed him back and then we sort of wrestled around a bit and I ended up spittin in his face. 311 Depp was also arrested in New York City in 1994 after causing significant damage to his room at The Mark Hotel where he was staying with Kate Moss his girlfriend. The charges were dropped against him after he agreed to pay US9 767 in damages. 312 Depp was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazi when the photographers tried to take his picture. He allegedly threatened them with a wooden plank when they approached him outside Mirabelle restaurant in central London on an early Sunday morning. 313 In 2012 UC Irvine medical professor Robin Eckert sued Depp and three security firms Premier Group International Damian Executive Production Inc. and Staff Pro Inc. 314 claiming to have been roughed up by his bodyguards at a concert in Los Angeles in 2011. During the incident she was allegedly hand-cuffed and dragged 40 feet across the floor resulting in injuries including a dislocated elbow. Depps attorneys contended that Eckert provoked the alleged assault and therefore consented to any assault and battery . 315 Eckerts court papers stated that Depp despite being his security guards direct manager did nothing to stop the attack. 316 Before the case went to trial Depp settled with Eckert for an undisclosed sum according to TMZ. 317 In April 2015 Depp and his then-wife Amber Heard breached Australias biosecurity laws when they failed to declare their two dogs to the customs when they flew to Queensland where he was working on a film. 318 319 Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation. 320 She was placed on a 1 000 one-month good behavior bond for producing a false document; 321 Heard and Depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the biosecurity laws. 321 The Guardian called the case the highest profile criminal quarantine case in Australian history. 321 In March 2016 Depp cut ties with his management company The Management Group TMG and sued them in January 2017 for alleged embezzlement and for allegedly improperly managing his money and leaving him over 40 million in debt. 322 323 TMG stated that Depp was responsible for his own fiscal mismanagement and countersued him for unpaid fees. 322 324 In a related suit Depp also sued his lawyers Bloom Hergott in January 2017. 325 Both lawsuits were settled the former in 2018 and the latter in 2019. 325 326 322 In 2018 two of Depps former bodyguards sued him for unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions. 327 Among other complaints the two bodyguards claimed in their suit that they were required to perform tasks that were beyond the scope of their capacity as bodyguards including being asked to repeatedly drive vehicles that contained illegal substances open containers and minors . 328 329 Despite this and despite being exposed to other unsafe working conditions while putting in 12-hour work shifts on the job without rest or meal breaks the bodyguards added they were neither paid overtime nor otherwise fairly or lawfully compensated. 327 328 The suit was settled in 2019. 330 Also in 2018 Depp was sued for allegedly hitting and verbally insulting a crew member while under the influence of alcohol on the set of City of Lies . 331 A lawyer for Depp told the media that Depp never touched the crew member as over a dozen witnesses present will attest ; meanwhile Depps legal team entered a court filing that did not admit that Depp hit the crew member but stated that the crew member provoked the incident with unlawful and wrongful conduct causing Depp and film director Brad Furman to fear for their safety. 332 A film script supervisor submitted a court declaration that Depp did not hit the crew member and only scolded him. 333 Before the lawsuit went to trial a tentative settlement regarding the dismissal of the lawsuit was reached between Depp and the crew member in July 2022. 333 In August 2022 Depp and Jeff Beck were accused of stealing an incarcerated African American mans poem by incorporating its verses into the lyrics to their song Sad Motherfuckin Parade in their 2022 collaborative album 18 . Bruce Jackson the folklorist who made the accusation requested that Depp and Beck give due credit to Slim Wilson the actual originator of the lyrics for the song. He also requested that if any profits are made from the album the two should donate them to an organization that aids African Americans. 334 In response Depp and Beck sued Jackson claiming that Sad Motherfuckin Parade is an original work of authorship and creativity and that Jacksons accusation amounts to a cash grab. Jackson responded by noting that he had never made any formal financial demands and while maintaining that Depp and Beck never wrote the lyrics to that song said that them suing the person who caught them stealing the lyrics is akin to a burglar suing a homeowner because he cut his hand on the kitchen window he broke getting in . 335 This lawsuit is still ongoing. In January 2024 actress Lola Glaudini on an episode of the podcast Powerful Truth Angels recounted an incident of verbal abuse from Depp during the shooting of the movie Blow 2001. 336 According to Glaudini she had been told by the films director Ted Demme to burst out laughing on cue to a line from Depp during the filming of a scene for the movie. In one take after several others of her following this direction Glaudini continued: 337 I hear the cue and I go hahaha I do a big laugh or whatever... Johnny Depp when they say cut walks over to me comes up to me sticks his finger in my faceand Im in a bikini on the ground like thisand he comes over and he goes Who the fuck do you think you are?

Oh now oh now its not so funny? Now you can shut up? Now you can fucking shut the fuck up? Oh its not funny now? The quiet that you are right now thats how you fucking stay. Lola Glaudini Powerful Truth Angels Episode 177 338 While noting that this was her first day of her first studio film ever and that she had been excited to work with Depp whom she then idolized Glaudini said that the incident left her almost in tears. 336 She further added that Depp later offered her a non-apology apology by blaming the incident on the Boston accent that he was doing for the film. 336 337 In response to Glaudinis accusation Depp through a representative said that he values good relationships with his coworkers. 336 In addition Sam Sarkara sound technician on Blow who has worked on several of Depps films including Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Choclat Mortdecai and Minamata said that during the filming of Blow he never heard anything like what Glaudini recounted. 337 Alcohol and drug use Depp has struggled with substance abuse for much of his life.
