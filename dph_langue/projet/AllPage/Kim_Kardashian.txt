Once they accessed Kardashians room they held a gun to her head tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around her mouth as a gag . 242 Kardashian who was placed in the bathtub was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life. 243 244 245 She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped. 246 On October 6 2016 it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed on hold indefinitely after the robbery. 247 After the robbery was announced several critics expressed skepticism about whether it was staged or not with some even drawing comparison to Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochtes recent false robbery claim . 248 249 On October 10 2016 a video was released showing Kardashian immediately after the robbery as police began conducting their investigation. In the video she is seen using the cell phone that she had reported stolen and did not have any of the markings she claimed from being bound by her captors prompting more questions as to whether or not the events were staged. 250 In response Kardashian filed lawsuits against several media outlets the following day and secured a gag order to get the video removed from any articles due to it being part of an active police investigation. 251 252 253 On October 25 2016 Kardashian dropped the lawsuit prompting more criticism that the robbery was a ploy to generate media attention. 254 255 Production resumed on Keeping Up with the Kardashians on October 26. 256 On January 9 2017 French police detained 17 persons of interest for questioning in the robbery case. 257 Later in 2017 16 people were arrested for their alleged involvement. 258 It was revealed in 2020 that French prosecutors would seek trial for 12 of the suspects. 259 The suspects who allegedly entered her room were of or near senior age and were named the Grandpa Robbers by the press. 260 In 2021 the suspects were still awaiting trial with at least one of the five who entered Kardashians room reportedly set to plead no contest to the charges. 261 Activism During an interview with Caity Weaver of GQ for the July 2016 issue Kardashian described herself as a Democrat and declared her support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election . 262 263 In January 2017 she tweeted a table of statistics that went viral highlighting statistics that show that gun violence in the United States kills 11 737 people annually while terrorism in the United States kills 14 people annually. In December 2017 the tweet was mentioned by the Royal Statistical Society in the announcement of its International Statistic of the Year for 2017. 264 265 On a trip to Uganda in October 2018 she and her husband met with President Yoweri Museveni . They had a press conference and Kanye talked about tourism in Uganda . They were criticized for meeting Museveni due to his being a dictator and his recent crackdown on the opposition and the Ugandan LGBT community . 266 267 268 In April 2019 Vogue reported that Kardashian was studying to pass the bar exam ; instead of attending law school she is reading law . 269 In 2021 Kardashian said she had failed her first-year law exam the baby bar for a second time performing slightly worse than her first attempt earlier in the year. 270 271 In December 2021 she passed the baby bar law exam on her fourth attempt. 272 In 2020 Kardashian condemned the actions of Azerbaijan in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and expressed her support for Armenia and the Republic of Artsakh . 273 274 On November 20 2021 it was reported that Kardashian and the English soccer club Leeds United F.C. with the help of Rabbi Moshe Margertten of the Tzedek Association 275 had financially helped female Afghan soccer players to make their way safely to England. The women and girls had escaped Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover but were stranded in Pakistan. 276 277 Armenian genocide recognition Kardashian at the Armenian genocide memorial in Yerevan Armenia in October 2019 Kardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry. 278 279 She is not a citizen of either Armenia or the United Kingdom and does not speak Armenian. 280 She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian genocide on numerous occasions and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement. 281 282 283 In April 2016 Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement by FactCheckArmenia.com denying the Armenian genocide . 284 In April 2021 Kardashian wrote a letter to President Joe Biden thanking him for officially recognizing the Armenian genocide and becoming the first United States president ever to do so. 285 286 In April 2015 Kardashian traveled to Armenia with her husband her sister Khloe and her eldest daughter and visited the Armenian Genocide Memorial Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan . 287 On October 10 2020 Kardashian announced she donated 1 million to Armenia Fund a humanitarian organization that supports Armenias development. 288 289 Prison reform and clemency advocacy Kardashian has worked in the area of prison reform advocating for the commutation of the sentence of Chris Young and also of Alice Marie Johnson a woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense as the leader of a major cocaine ring in Tennessee 290 291 292 which was granted by President Donald Trump in June 2018. 293 294 Along with Van Jones and Jared Kushner she was instrumental in persuading President Trump to support the First Step Act which enacted major reforms in the US prison system. Van Jones later stated that without Kardashian the act would have never passed because it would not have received the presidents support. It was later passed by a great majority in the US Senate . 295 296 297 Kardashian second from right welcomes sentence commutation recipients with President Donald J. Trump 2018 In 2019 Kardashian largely funded the 90 Days to Freedom campaign an initiative to release nonviolent drug offenders from life sentences by attorneys Brittany K. Barnett and MiAngel Cody. 298 The effort resulted in 17 persons being released under provisions of the First Step Act . 298 Kardashian was widely credited for the success of the campaign in media headlines. 299 Commentary on her involvement ranged from praise to assertions that it was a public relations stunt to accusations that she was taking the credit for work she did not do. 298 In a Facebook post from May 7 of that year Barnett commented on the divisive and underfunded nature of the criminal justice reform space adding Kim linked arms with us to support us when foundations turned us down. We and our clients and their families have a lot of love for her and are deeply grateful for her. 300 301 In April 2022 Kardashian advocated for the clemency of Melissa Lucio the only woman of Hispanic descent on Texas death row in a series of tweets. She tweeted I recently just read about the case of Melissa Lucio and wanted to share her story with you. She has been on death row for over 14 years for her daughters death that was a tragic accident. 302 303 Lucio is on death row for the abuse and death of her daughter who was two years old. Kardashian deleted the series of tweets the same day. 302 When Lucio was granted a stay of execution on April 25 Kardashian celebrated on her social media channels. 304 In July 2022 Kardashian expressed support and petitioned for the release of rapper Gunna who was imprisoned without bond charged with one count of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act . 305 However in October of the same year Gunna was again denied release from jail ahead of his January trial. 306 In December Gunna pled guilty to a single charge of racketeering and was sentenced to five years in prison with one year commuted to time served and the rest of the sentence suspended subject to probation conditions. He was soon released from jail and instead was ordered to serve 500 hours of community service . 307 308 Filmography Main article: List of Kim Kardashian performances This section lists select works only.
