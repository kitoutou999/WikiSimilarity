Upon review of the documents Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing. 242 243 The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9 2023 at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony. 244 In late 2022 Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so. 245 246 Five months later Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer. 247 On November 20 2023 in a U.S. District Court in Texas X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters manipulated the X platform in that it used accounts that followed major brands and resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts. 248 The Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the 13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to 09 financial crisis adding that the allure of banking Elon Musk providing capital for him to buy a company not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan but you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan. 249 The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost 24 billion in equity value a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes or devastating corporate scandals. 250 Two years after the acquisition Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79 of its value. 251 Leadership style Musk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012 Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a nano-manager . 252 The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist . 253 Musk does not make formal business plans . 253 He has forced employees to adopt the companys own jargon and launched ambitious risky and costly projects against his advisors recommendations such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot . His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceXs rocket 254 vertical integration as of 2018 has caused many usability problems for Teslas internal corporate software. 252 needs update Musks handling of employeeswhom he communicates with directly through mass emailshas been characterized as carrot and stick rewarding those who offer constructive criticism while also being known to impulsively threaten swear at and fire his employees. 255 256 257 Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours sometimes 80 hours per week. 258 He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees 259 257 such as during the Model 3 production hell in 2018. 257 In 2022 Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Teslas workforce due to his concerns about the economy. 260 That same month he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office. 261 He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024. Musks leadership has been praised by some who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors 252 and criticized by others who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as showing a lack of human understanding. 257 262 The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees. 263 The Wall Street Journal reported that after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as self-driving he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer lives at risk with some employees resigning in consequence. 264 Other activities Musk Foundation Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001 265 266 whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research development and advocacy for interests including human space exploration pediatrics renewable energy and safe artificial intelligence ; and support science and engineering educational efforts. 267 As of 2020 the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania and his brother Kimbals nonprofit Big Green . 268 From 2002 to 2018 the foundation gave 25 million directly to nonprofit organizations nearly half of which went to Musks OpenAI 269 which was a nonprofit at the time. 270 The Foundation also allocated 100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas. 271 In 2012 Musk took the Giving Pledge thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will. 272 He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation including 100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology. 273 Vox said in February 2021 the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text. 269 In 2020 Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1 because he had given away less than 1 of his net worth. 268 In November 2021 Musk donated 5.7 billion of Teslas shares to charity according to regulatory filings. 274 However Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation bringing Musk Foundations assets up to 9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed 160 million to nonprofits that year. 275 Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022 the Musk Foundation gave away 230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundations funds went to causes connected to Musk his family or his businesses. 276 Hyperloop Main articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition A tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX In August 2013 Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs. 277 Later that year Musk unveiled the concept which he dubbed the Hyperloop. 278 The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs. 279 The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area at an estimated cost of 6 billion. 280 The proposal if technologically feasible at the costs cited would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. 281 Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train proposal current in California at the time and consider more creative ideas. 282 In 2015 Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track for a 20152017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017 and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination. 283 In July 2017 Musk said that he had received verbal government approval to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington D.C. with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore . 284 Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021. 285 The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers. 286 Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues planning complexity low passenger capacity and extremely high costs. 287 288 Jose Gomez-Ibanez a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard said It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision . 289 OpenAI and xAI Further information: OpenAI and xAI company In December 2015 Musk co-founded OpenAI a not-for-profit artificial intelligence AI research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. 290 A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems against governments and corporations. 28 Musk pledged 1 billion of funding to OpenAI. 291 In 2023 Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of 100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that according to its own investigation of public records only 15 million of OpenAIs funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about 50 million. 292 In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot . 293 Since then OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning producing neural networks such as ChatGPT producing human-like text 294 and DALL-E generating digital images from natural language descriptions. 295 On July 12 2023 Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI. 296 Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla. 297 Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case Further information: Tham Luang cave rescue In July 2018 Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand . 298 Richard Stanton leader of the international rescue diving team encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musks involvement distracted from the rescue effort . 299 Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand. 300 301 Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine stating that it wasnt practical for the rescue mission. 298 302 In March 2019 Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort. 303 Soon after the rescue Vernon Unsworth a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success maintaining that Musk had no conception of what the cave passage was like and can stick his submarine where it hurts . Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a pedo guy . 304 He then deleted the tweets 304 apologized 305 and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett a software engineer which had caused his followers to harass her. 306 In an email to BuzzFeed News Musk later called Unsworth a child rapist and said that he had married a child. 307 308 In September Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking 190 million in damages. 309 310 311 In his defense Musk argued that pedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with creepy old man and is used to insult a persons appearance and demeanor . 36 During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019 the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable. 312 313 2018 cannabis incident In September 2018 Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast during which he appeared to smoke a joint . 314 In 2022 Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors. 315 In a 2019 60 Minutes interview Musk had said I do not smoke pot .

After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed 325 326 327 Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident including Donie OSullivan Keith Olbermann and journalists from The New York Times The Washington Post CNN and The Intercept . 328 Musk equated the reporting to doxxing . 329 Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker. 330 Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists accounts should be reinstated which resulted in reinstating the accounts. 331 Company towns Main articles: Boca Chica Village Texas and Snailbrook Texas After 2020 thousands of acres of land just outside Austin Texas were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of 2.5 billion. 332 333 The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County Texas began in 2021 according to reports by the Wall Street Journal . 334 Musks then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning. 334 The name Snailbrook alludes to The Boring Companys stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move. 334 In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people. 335 There are plans to establish a school and a university there. 332 Wealth Main article: Wealth of Elon Musk Musk made 175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002. 336 He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012 with a net worth of 2 billion. 337 Personal views and Twitter usage Further information: Views of Elon Musk Musk credits science fiction writers particularly Robert A. Heinlein for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures including SpaceX Grok and his libertarian inclinations. 338 339 Since joining Twitter now known as X in 2009 340 Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023 update . 341 He posts memes promotes business interests and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues. 342 Musks statements have provoked controversy such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns 343 344 and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler . 345 The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as chaotic and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests. 346 As CEO of Twitter Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia s apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop . 347 Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance. 348 349 Finance Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 350 351 The free market in his view would achieve the best solution and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences. 352 Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies. 353 As of February 2024 Tesla has made 9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits . 354 355 356 357 358 Tax credits offered in California at the United States federal level and by other governments have enabled Teslas battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles. 359 Musk a longtime opponent of short-selling has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal. 360 361 Wired magazine speculated that Musks opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies. 362 In early 2021 he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze . 363 364 In December 2022 Musk sold 3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla equal to 22 million shares in the company 365 despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares. 366 Technology Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies . 367 Given the influence of Musks tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets 368 his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some such as economist Nouriel Roubini . 369 Musks social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently Teslas 2021 announcement against the backdrop of Musks social media behavior that it bought 1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin raised questions. 370 Teslas announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining . A few months later in response to the criticism Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved. 371 372 Despite The Boring Companys involvement in building mass transit infrastructure Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport private vehicles. 373 374 375 His comments have been called elitist and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical more energy efficient and requires much less space than private cars. 374 376 375 Existential threats Musk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference Musk has been described as believing in longtermism emphasizing the needs of future populations. 377 Accordingly Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity . 378 379 He has warned of a Terminator -like AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development. 380 381 In 2015 Musk was a cosignatory along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence which called for the ban of autonomous weapons . 382 Musks AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 383 384 and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016. 385 Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI 386 and has advocated for a carbon tax . 387 Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump s stance on climate change 388 389 and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trumps 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement . 390 Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a multiplanetary species . 391 He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars . 392 393 He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them. 394 Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline 395 396 saying that Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization. 397 Speaking at The Wall Street Journal s CEO Council session in 2021 Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate and consequent population decline is one of the biggest risks to human civilization . 398 According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars. 399 He later denied the claim. 400 Politics Musk with Senator Dianne Feinstein at the opening of the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2010 left and with Vice President Mike Pence alongside then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at the Kennedy Space Center before SpaceXs Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch in 2020 right Musks views are generally described as right-wing and conservative. 401 402 403 404 405 While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022. 406 He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation 407 408 409 and numerous conspiracy theories . 410 411 Despite this Musk still describes himself as politically moderate rejecting the conservative label. 412 Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California.

He added that if you kill somebodys child in Gaza you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli. 460 On November 17 2023 Musk announced a policy change on the X platform stating that X users who use terms such as decolonization and from the river to the sea or similar expressions that necessarily imply genocide of the Jewish people in Israel will be suspended. 461 Several weeks later Musk traveled to Israel by visiting the kibbutz Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which had been part of the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and described it as jarring. 462 In August 2024 Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country saying Shouldnt you be concerned about attacks on all communities? 463 Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the effects of mass migration and open borders Musk tweeted Civil war is inevitable . His comments were condemned by Starmers official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson s account after Robinson had been banned under Twitters previous owners and interacted with him on the platform. 464 465 466 467 Musk went on to refer to Starmer as two-tier Keir and ask Why arent all communities protected in Britain? 468 469 Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainments camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters. 470 471 On September 15 2024 after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation. 472 On September 19 the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post. 473 Accusations of antisemitism The Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories 474 although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism. 475 On November 15 2023 Twitter user Charles Weber who identifies as a Jewish conservative posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase Hitler was right ; Weber captioned the video: To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting Hitler was right: You got something you want to say? Why dont you say it to our faces . 476 477 In response a second user posted Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. Im deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country dont exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face there it is. To this second user Musk replied You have said the actual truth. 476 477 Musk further clarified that he doesnt believe that all Jewish communities hate white people but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League ADL. 478 He added You sic right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities but it is also not just limited to ADL . 479 The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments 480 and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push hatred against Whites. 481 482 The following day Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride . 483 484 Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets. 485 At the DealBook Summit on November 29 2023 after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musks recent post journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded I hope they stop. Dont advertise and If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising blackmail me with money go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is. ; Musk singled out Iger saying Hey Bob if youre in the audience. 486 487 Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweetsthe one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theorywas a mistake saying I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry. 488 Musk described his tweet as one of the most foolish if not the most foolish thing Ive done. 489 490 In January 2024 Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev . 491 He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism. 492 The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image rehabilitation tour. 493 COVID-19 Musk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic . 494 495 He spread misinformation about the virus including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated. 496 In March 2020 Musk stated The coronavirus panic is dumb. 497 498 In an email to Tesla employees Musk referred to COVID-19 as a specific form of the common cold and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1 of the U.S. population. 494 On March 19 2020 Musk predicted that there would be probably close to zero new cases in the U.S. by end of April . 495 Politico labeled this statement one of the most audacious confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications of 2020 . 499 Musk also falsely stated that children are essentially immune to COVID-19. 500 501 Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020 defying the local shelter-in-place order. 494 502 503 In May 2020 he reopened the Tesla factory defying the local stay-at-home order 504 505 and warned workers that they would be unpaid and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized if they did not report to work. 505 In December 2022 Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci . 506 507 In March 2020 Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage . 508 After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musks offer 509 Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party. 508 However Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely. 510 511 In September 2020 Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine because he and his children were not at risk for COVID . 512 513 Two months later Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results. 514 Following this a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test referring to Musk as Space Karen which then trended on Twitter . 514 515 In December 2021 Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was unequivocal but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates . 516 Personal life In 2002 Musk became a U.S. citizen. 517 From the early 2000s until late 2020 Musk resided in California where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded. 518 He then relocated to Austin Texas saying that California had become complacent about its economic success. 518 519 520 While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021 Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome although he has never been medically diagnosed. 521 522 During a South African safari in late 2000 he contracted malaria and was then hospitalized in an intensive care unit back in California. 523 Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg. 524 In his leisure time he plays video games including Quake Diablo IV Elden Ring and Polytopia . 525 526 Musk has stated he uses prescribed ketamine for occasional depression 527 while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally. 528 529 530 Relationships and children Musk has at least 12 children one of whom is deceased. 2 He met his first wife Canadian author Justine Wilson while attending Queens University in Ontario Canada; they married in 2000. 531 In 2002 their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks. 532 After his death the couple used in vitro fertilization IVF to continue their family; 533 they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006. 533 The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children. 534 535 In 2022 the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson 536 reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mothers surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk. 536 Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to destroy the woke mind virus . 537 538 In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson s podcast Musk said regarding Vivian that he had lost his son sic essentially because of gender-affirming care . He commented: You know they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason its called deadnaming is because your son sic is dead and went on to state that the eldest twin is dead killed by the woke mind virus . 539 Vivian responded publicly criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; claiming that Musk was cold quick to anger uncaring and narcissistic whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine. 540 In 2008 Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley . 541 They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland. 542 543 In 2012 the couple divorced before remarrying the following year. 544 After briefly filing for divorce in 2014 544 Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016. 545 Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017; 546 he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012. 547 In 2018 Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating. 548 Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020. 549 550 Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name X A-12 which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet 551 552 which they then changed to X A-Xii. 553 554 They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name. 555 In December 2021 Grimes and Musk had a second child a daughter born via surrogacy . 1 Despite the pregnancy Musk confirmed reports that the couple were semi-separated in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021 he said he was single. 556 557 In March 2022 Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend but were very fluid. 1 Later that month Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again. 558 In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child a son. 559 In October 2023 Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son. 560 561 562 In July 2022 Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis director of operations and special projects at Neuralink in November 2021. 563 They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news raised questions about workplace ethics given that Zilis directly reported to Musk. 564 Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy. 565 2 Also in July 2022 The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin in 2021 leading to their divorce the following year. 566 Musk denied the report. 567 Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett who has been described as an occasional girlfriend. 568 Legal matters after 2020 Further information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk ; List of lawsuits involving Tesla Inc. ; and Criticism of Tesla Inc. In May 2022 Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018 Musk SpaceX and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a 250 000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims. 569 Musk responded If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light . He accused the article from Business Insider of being a politically motivated hit piece . 570 571 After the release of the article Teslas stock fell by more than 6 572 and Barron s wrote ...some investors considered key-man risk the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual. 573 In April 2023 the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein s sex trafficking operation. 574 The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath. 574 Musks former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children. 575 576 On July 27 2024 Grimes mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren. 577 Ben Brody a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over 1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group near Portland Oregon . 578 579 580 According to Brodys complaint one of Musks X posts promoted conspiracy theories that Ben Brodys alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a false flag operation to deceive the American public . 578 The complaint also alleged that Musks accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats. 578 579 581 In February 2024 Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit. 582 In the deposition Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public. 583 584 In October 2023 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022. 585 586 587 Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him. 585 587 In February 2024 Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again. 588 In January 2024 Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musks 55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded. 589 McCormick called the compensation granted by the companys board an unfathomable sum that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling Musk posted on X: Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware. 590 A re-ratification shareholders vote passed in mid-June 2024 though much follow-up litigation is expected including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed coercive tactics to move the vote in his favor. 591 In June 2024 The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a romantic relationship with a former intern at SpaceX confirmed with affidavits supplied by the interns lawyers who also represent Musk and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to have his babies. 592 In the same month eight ex-employees the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment. 593 Also in June 2024 a former Twitter executive sued Musk for cheating him and other ousted executives out of 200 million in severance pay. 594 In August 2024 Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X formerly Twitter. 595 596 597 Later that month Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged acts of aggravated cyber harassment in which Musk was named. 598 Public perception Further information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk Musk right and then-President Barack Obama at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9 2010 Though his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions while also often making controversial statements contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Biographer Ashley Vance described peoples opinions of Musk as polarized due to his part philosopher part troll role on Twitter. 599 Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man 2008. 600 Musk also had a cameo appearance in the films 2010 sequel Iron Man 2 . 601 Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills 2013 602 Why Him? 2016 603 and Men in Black: International 2019. 604 Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons The Musk Who Fell to Earth 2015 605 The Big Bang Theory The Platonic Permutation 2015 606 South Park Members Only 2016 607 608 Young Sheldon A Patch a Modem and a Zantac 2017 609 Rick and Morty One Crew over the Crewcoos Morty 2019 610 611 and Saturday Night Live 2021. 612 He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction 2015 and the Werner Herzog -directed Lo and Behold 2016. 613 614 Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008 615 the Federation Aeronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010 616 and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012. 617 In 2015 he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University 618 and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership . 619 Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society FRS in 2018. 620 In February 2022 Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering . 621 Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010 622 2013 623 2018 624 and 2021. 625 Musk was selected as Time s Person of the Year for 2021.
