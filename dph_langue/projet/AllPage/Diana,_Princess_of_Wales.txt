She was the first wife of Charles III then Prince of Wales and mother of Princes William and Harry . Her activism and glamour which made her an international icon earned her enduring popularity. Diana was born into the British nobility and grew up close to the royal family living at Park House on their Sandringham estate . In 1981 while working as a nursery teachers assistant she became engaged to Charles the eldest son of Elizabeth II . Their wedding took place at St Pauls Cathedral in July 1981 and made her Princess of Wales a role in which she was enthusiastically received by the public. The couple had two sons William and Harry who were then respectively second and third in the line of succession to the British throne . Dianas marriage to Charles suffered due to their incompatibility and extramarital affairs. They separated in 1992 soon after the breakdown of their relationship became public knowledge. Their marital difficulties were widely publicised and the couple divorced in 1996. As Princess of Wales Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions across the Commonwealth realms . She was celebrated in the media for her unconventional approach to charity work. Her patronages were initially centred on children and the elderly but she later became known for her involvement in two particular campaigns: one involved the social attitudes towards and the acceptance of AIDS patients and the other for the removal of landmines promoted through the International Red Cross . She also raised awareness and advocated for ways to help people affected by cancer and mental illness. Diana was initially noted for her shyness but her charisma and friendliness endeared her to the public and helped her reputation survive the public collapse of her marriage. Considered photogenic she is regarded as a fashion icon of the 1980s and 1990s. In August 1997 Diana died in a car crash in Paris; the incident led to extensive public mourning and global media attention. An inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing following Operation Paget an investigation by the Metropolitan Police . Her legacy has had a significant effect on the royal family and British society . 1 Early life Diana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961 the fourth of five children of John Spencer Viscount Althorp 19241992 and Frances Spencer Viscountess Althorp nee Roche ; 19362004. 2 She was delivered at Park House Sandringham Norfolk. 3 The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; 4 her grandmothers Cynthia Spencer Countess Spencer and Ruth Roche Baroness Fermoy had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother . 5 Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line and no name was chosen for a week until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and Lady Diana Spencer a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales as a potential bride for Frederick Prince of Wales . 6 Within the family she was also known informally as Duch a reference to her duchess-like attitude in childhood. 7 On 30 August 1961 8 Diana was baptised at St. Mary Magdalene Church Sandringham . 6 She grew up with three siblings: Sarah Jane and Charles . 9 Her infant brother John died shortly after his birth one year before Diana was born. 10 The desire for an heir added strain to her parents marriage and Lady Althorp was sent to Harley Street clinics in London to determine the cause of the problem . 6 The experience was described as humiliating by Dianas younger brother Charles: It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce because I dont think they ever got over it . 6 Diana grew up in Park House situated on the Sandringham estate . 11 The family leased the house from its owner Queen Elizabeth II whom Diana called Aunt Lilibet since childhood. 12 The royal family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House and Diana played with Princes Andrew and Edward . 13 Althorp pictured in 2006 the Spencer family seat Diana was seven years old when her parents divorced. 14 Her mother later began a relationship with Peter Shand Kydd and married him in 1969. 15 Diana lived with her mother in London during her parents separation in 1967 but during that years Christmas holidays Lord Althorp refused to let his daughter return to London with Lady Althorp. Shortly afterwards he won custody of Diana with support from his former mother-in-law Lady Fermoy. 16 In 1976 Lord Althorp married Raine Countess of Dartmouth . 17 Dianas relationship with her stepmother was particularly bad. 18 She resented Raine whom she called a bully . On one occasion Diana pushed her down the stairs. 18 She later described her childhood as very unhappy and very unstable the whole thing . 19 She became known as Lady Diana after her father later inherited the title of Earl Spencer in 1975 at which point her father moved the entire family from Park House to Althorp the Spencer seat in Northamptonshire . 20 Education and career Diana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her governess Gertrude Allen. 21 She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in Kings Lynn Norfolk and moved to Riddlesworth Hall School an all-girls boarding school near Thetford when she was nine. 22 She joined her sisters at West Heath Girls School in Sevenoaks Kent in 1973. 23 She did not perform well academically failing her O-levels twice. 24 25 Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath. 26 She left West Heath when she was sixteen. 27 Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time. 28 She demonstrated musical ability as a skilled pianist. 26 She also excelled in swimming and diving and studied ballet and tap dance . 29 Coleherne Court in Chelsea London where Diana lived between 1979 and 1981. An English Heritage blue plaque is located at the address. In 1978 Diana worked for three months as a nanny for Philippa and Jeremy Whitaker in Hampshire. 30 After attending Institut Alpin Videmanette a finishing school in Rougemont Switzerland for one term and leaving after the Easter term of 1978 31 Diana returned to London where she shared her mothers flat with two school friends. 32 In London she took an advanced cooking course and worked at a series of low-paying jobs; she worked as a dance instructor for youth until a skiing accident caused her to miss three months of work. 33 She then found employment as a playgroup pre-school assistant did some cleaning work for her sister Sarah and several of her friends and acted as a hostess at parties. She spent time working as a nanny for the Robertsons an American family living in London 34 35 and worked as a nursery teachers assistant at the Young England School in Pimlico . 36 In July 1979 her mother bought her a flat at Coleherne Court in Earls Court as an 18th birthday present. 37 She lived there with three flatmates until 25 February 1981. 38 Personal life Diana first met Charles Prince of Wales the Queens eldest son and heir apparent when she was 16 in November 1977. He was then 29 and dating her older sister Sarah. 39 40 Charles and Diana were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 and he took a serious interest in her as a potential bride. 41 The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht Britannia for a sailing weekend to Cowes . This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral Castle the royal familys Scottish residence to meet his family. 42 43 She was well received by the Queen the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh . Charles subsequently courted Diana in London. He proposed on 6 February 1981 at Windsor Castle and she accepted but their engagement was kept secret for two and a half weeks. 38 Engagement and wedding Further information: Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer and Wedding dress of Lady Diana Spencer Diana and Charless wedding commemorated on a stamp by the Post of Seychelles Their engagement became official on 24 February 1981. 21 Diana selected her own engagement ring . 21 Following the engagement she left her occupation as a nursery teachers assistant and temporarily lived at the Queen Mothers residence Clarence House . 44 She subsequently resided at Buckingham Palace until the wedding 44 where according to the biographer Ingrid Seward her life was incredibly lonely . 45 Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry the first in line to the throne since Anne Hyde married James Duke of York and Albany later James VII and II over 300 years earlier and she was also the first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement. 21 26 Dianas first public appearance with Charles was at a charity ball held at Goldsmiths Hall in March 1981 where she was introduced to Princess Grace of Monaco . 44 Diana became Princess of Wales at age 20 when she married Charles then 32 on 29 July 1981. The wedding was held at St Pauls Cathedral which offered more seating than Westminster Abbey a church that was generally used for royal weddings. 21 26 The service was widely described as a fairytale wedding and was watched by a global television audience of 750 million people while 600 000 spectators lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the couple en route to the ceremony. 21 46 At the altar Diana inadvertently reversed the order of his first two names saying Philip Charles Arthur George instead. 46 She did not say she would obey him; that traditional vow was left out at the couples request which caused some comment at the time. 47 Diana wore a dress valued at 9 000 equivalent to 43 573 in 2023 with a 25-foot 7.62-metre train. 48 Within a few years of the wedding the Queen extended Diana visible tokens of membership in the royal family lending her the Queen Marys Lovers Knot Tiara 49 50 and granting her the badge of the Royal Family Order of Elizabeth II . 51 52 Children The couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House near Tetbury . On 5 November 1981 Dianas pregnancy was announced. 53 In January 198212 weeks into the pregnancyDiana fell down a staircase at Sandringham suffering some bruising and the royal gynaecologist George Pinker was summoned from London; the foetus was uninjured. 54 Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling so inadequate . 55 On 21 June 1982 she gave birth to the couples first son Prince William . 56 She subsequently suffered from postpartum depression after her first pregnancy. 57 Amidst some media criticism she decided to take Williamwho was still a babyon her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand and the decision was popularly applauded. By her own admission Diana had not initially intended to take William until Malcolm Fraser the Australian prime minister made the suggestion. 58 A second son Harry was born on 15 September 1984. 59 Diana said she and Charles were closest during her pregnancy with Harry. 60 She was aware their second child was a boy but did not share the knowledge with anyone else including Charles who hoped for a girl. 61 Diana gave her sons wider experiences than was usual for royal children. 21 62 63 She rarely deferred to Charles or to the royal family and was often intransigent when it came to the children. She chose their first given names dismissed a royal family nanny and engaged one of her own choosing selected their schools and clothing planned their outings and took them to school herself as often as her schedule permitted. She also organised her public duties around their timetables. 64 Diana was reported to have described Harry as naughty just like me and William as my little wise old man whom she started to rely on as her confidant by his early teens. 65 Problems and separation With Charles during the royal tour of Australia in 1983 Five years into the marriage the couples incompatibility and age difference became visible and damaging. 66 In 1986 Diana began a relationship with James Hewitt the familys former riding instructor and in the same year Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles . The media speculated that Hewitt not Charles was Harrys father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry but Hewitt and others have denied this. Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair. 60 67 By 1987 cracks in the marriage had become visible and the couples unhappiness and cold attitude towards one another were being reported by the press 45 68 who dubbed them the Glums because of their evident discomfort in each others company. 69 70 In 1989 Diana was at a birthday party for Parker Bowless sister Annabel Elliot when she confronted Parker Bowles about her and Charless extramarital affair. 71 72 These affairs were later exposed in 1992 with the publication of Andrew Morton s book Diana: Her True Story . 73 74 The book which also revealed Dianas allegedly suicidal unhappiness caused a media storm. In 1991 James Colthurst conducted secret interviews with Diana in which she had talked about her marital issues and difficulties. These recordings were later used as a source for Mortons book. 75 76 During her lifetime both Diana and Morton denied her direct involvement in the writing process and maintained that family and friends were the books main source; however after her death Morton acknowledged Dianas role in writing the tell-all in the books updated edition Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words . 77 The Queen and Prince Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana and unsuccessfully tried to effect a reconciliation. 78 Philip wrote to Diana and expressed his disappointment at the extramarital affairs of both her and Charles; he asked her to examine their behaviour from the others point of view. 79 Diana reportedly found the letters difficult but nevertheless appreciated that he was acting with good intent. 80 It was alleged by some people including Dianas close friend Simone Simmons that Diana and Philip had a tense relationship; 81 82 83 however other observers said their letters provided no sign of friction between them. 84 Philip later issued a statement publicly denying allegations of his insulting Diana. 85 During 1992 and 1993 leaked tapes of telephone conversations reflected negatively on both Charles and Diana. Tape recordings of Diana and James Gilbey were made public in August 1992 86 and transcripts were published the same month. 21 The article Squidgygate was followed in November 1992 by the leaked Camillagate tapes intimate exchanges between Charles and Parker Bowles published in the tabloids . 87 88 In December 1992 Prime Minister John Major announced the couples amicable separation to the House of Commons . 89 90 Carrying out an engagement in South Shields 1992 Between 1992 and 1993 Diana hired a voice coach Peter Settelen to help her develop her public speaking voice. 91 In a videotape recorded by Settelen in 1992 Diana said that in 1984 through to 1986 she had been deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment. 92 93 It is thought she was referring to Barry Mannakee 94 who was transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986 after his managers had determined that his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate. 93 95 Diana said in the tape that Mannakee had been chucked out from his role as her bodyguard following suspicion that the two were having an affair. 92 Penny Junor suggested in her 1998 book that Diana was in a romantic relationship with Mannakee. 96 Dianas friends dismissed the claim as absurd. 96 In the subsequently released tapes Diana said she had feelings for that someone saying I was quite happy to give all this up and just to go off and live with him . She described him as the greatest friend shes ever had though she denied any sexual relationship with him. 97 She also spoke bitterly of her husband saying that He made me feel so inadequate in every possible way that each time I came up for air he pushed me down again. 98 99 Although she blamed Parker Bowles for her marital troubles Diana began to believe her husband had been involved in other affairs. In October 1993 Diana wrote to her butler Paul Burrell telling him that she believed her husband was now in love with his personal assistant Tiggy Legge-Bourke who was also his sons former nannyand was planning to have her killed to make the path clear for him to marry Tiggy . 100 101 Legge-Bourke had been hired by Charles as a young companion for his sons while they were in his care and Diana was resentful of Legge-Bourke and her relationship with the young princes. 102 Charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby on 29 June 1994. In the interview he said he had rekindled his relationship with Parker Bowles in 1986 only after his marriage to Diana had irretrievably broken down . 103 104 105 In the same year Dianas affair with Hewitt was exposed in detail in the book Princess in Love by Anna Pasternak with Hewitt acting as the main source. 65 Diana was evidently disturbed and outraged when the book was released although Pasternak claimed Hewitt had acted with Dianas support to avoid having the affair covered in Andrew Mortons second book. 65 In the same year the News of the World claimed that Diana had had an affair with the married art dealer Oliver Hoare . 106 107 According to Hoares obituary there was little doubt she had been in a relationship with him. 108 However Diana denied any romantic relationship with Hoare whom she described as a friend. 109 110 She was also linked by the press to the rugby union player Will Carling 111 112 and private equity investor Theodore J. Forstmann 113 114 yet these claims were neither confirmed nor proven. 115 116 Divorce Kensington Palace pictured in 2018 Dianas home and the site of her 1995 Panorama interview The journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama . The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995. 117 Diana discussed her own and her husbands extramarital affairs. 118 Referring to Charless relationship with Parker Bowles she said: Well there were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded. She also expressed doubt about her husbands suitability for kingship. 117 The authors Tina Brown Sally Bedell Smith and Sarah Bradford support Dianas admission in the interview that she had suffered from depression bulimia and had engaged numerous times in the act of self-harm ; the shows transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental health problems. 117 The combination of illnesses from which Diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had borderline personality disorder . 119 120 It was later revealed that Bashir had used forged bank statements to win Diana and her brothers trust to secure the interview falsely indicating people close to her had been paid for spying. 121 Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue and concluded that Bashir had little difficulty in playing on Dianas fears and paranoia a sentiment that was shared by Dianas son William. 122 123 The interview proved to be the tipping point. On 20 December Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had sent letters to Charles and Diana advising them to divorce. 124 125 The Queens move was backed by Prime Minister John Major and by senior privy counsellors and according to the BBC was decided after two weeks of talks. 126 Charles formally agreed to the divorce in a written statement soon after. 124 In February 1996 Diana announced her agreement after negotiations with Charles and representatives of the Queen 127 irritating Buckingham Palace by issuing her own announcement of the divorce agreement and its terms. In July 1996 the couple agreed on the terms of their divorce. 128 This followed shortly after Dianas accusation that Charless personal assistant Tiggy Legge-Bourke had aborted his child after which Legge-Bourke instructed her solicitor Peter Carter-Ruck to demand an apology. 129 130 Dianas private secretary Patrick Jephson resigned shortly before the story broke later writing that Diana had exulted in accusing Legge-Bourke of having had an abortion . 131 132 The rumours of Legge-Bourkes alleged abortion were apparently spread by Martin Bashir as a means to gain his Panorama interview with Diana. 133 The decree nisi was granted on 15 July 1996 and the divorce was finalised on 28 August 1996. 134 135 Diana was represented by Anthony Julius in the case. 136 The couple shared custody of their children. 137 She received a lump sum settlement of 17 million equivalent to 40 million in 2023 as well as 400 000 per year. The couple signed a confidentiality agreement that prohibited them from discussing the details of the divorce or of their married life. 138 128 Days before letters patent were issued with general rules to regulate royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style Her Royal Highness and instead was styled Diana Princess of Wales . As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne she was still considered to be a member of the royal family and was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage. 139 The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style of Royal Highness after her divorce but Charles had insisted on removing it. 128 Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: Dont worry Mummy I will give it back to you one day when I am king . 140 Almost a year before according to Tina Brown Philip had warned Diana: If you dont behave my girl well take your title away. She is said to have replied: My title is a lot older than yours Philip. 141 Post-divorce After her divorce Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of Kensington Palace that she had shared with Charles since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year. She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted to use the state apartments at St Jamess Palace . 128 142 In a book published in 2003 Paul Burrell claimed Dianas private letters had revealed that her brother Lord Spencer had refused to allow her to live at Althorp despite her request. 130 The allegations were proven to be untrue as Spencer received legal apologies from different newspapers including The Times in 2021 which admitted that having considered his sisters safety and in line with police advice the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties including Wormleighton Manor the Spencer familys original ancestral home . 143 However he could not offer Garden House cottage on the Althorp estate to Diana as the home was intended for a member of staff. 143 Diana was also given an allowance to run her private office which was responsible for her charity work and royal duties but from September 1996 onwards she was required to pay her bills and any expenditure incurred by her or on her behalf. 144 Furthermore she continued to have access to the jewellery that she had received during her marriage and was allowed to use the air transport of the British royal family and government . 128 Diana was also offered security by Metropolitan Police s Royalty Protection Group which she benefitted from while travelling with her sons but had refused it in the final years of her life in an attempt to distance herself from the royal family. 145 146 After her death it was revealed that Diana had been in discussion with Majors successor Tony Blair about a special role that would provide a government platform for her campaigns and charities to make her capable of endorsing Britains interests overseas. 147 Diana retained close friendships with several celebrities including Elton John Liza Minnelli George Michael Michael Jackson and Gianni Versace whose funeral she attended in 1997. 148 149 She dated the British-Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan who was called the love of her life by many of her closest friends after her death 150 151 152 and she is said to have described him as Mr. Wonderful . 153 154 155 156 In May 1996 Diana visited Lahore upon invitation of Imran Khan a relative of Hasnat Khan and visited the latters family in secret. 157 158 Khan was intensely private and the relationship was conducted in secrecy with Diana lying to members of the press who questioned her about it. Their relationship lasted almost two years with differing accounts of who ended it. 158 159 She is said to have spoken of her distress when he ended their relationship. 150 However according to Khans testimony at the inquest into her death it was Diana who ended their relationship in the summer of 1997. 160 Burrell also said the relationship was ended by Diana in July 1997. 81 Burrell also claimed that Dianas mother Frances Shand Kydd disapproved of her daughters relationship with a Muslim man. 161 By the time of Dianas death in 1997 she had not spoken to her mother in four months. 162 163 By contrast her relationship with her estranged stepmother had reportedly improved. 164 165 Within a month Diana began a relationship with Dodi Fayed the son of her summer host Mohamed Al-Fayed . 166 That summer Diana had considered taking her sons on a holiday to the Hamptons on Long Island New York but security officials had prevented it. After deciding against a trip to Thailand she accepted Fayeds invitation to join his family in the south of France where his compound and large security detail would not cause concern to the Royal Protection squad. Mohamed Al-Fayed bought the Jonikal a 60-metre multimillion-pound yacht on which to entertain Diana and her sons. 166 167 168 Tina Brown later claimed that Dianas romance with Fayed and her four-month relationship with Gulu Lalvani were a ploy to inflame the true object of her affections Hasnat Khan . 65 In the years after her death Burrell journalist Richard Kay and voice coach Stewart Pierce have claimed that Diana was also thinking about buying a property in the United States. 169 170 171 Princess of Wales In Halifax Nova Scotia 1983 Following her engagement to Charles Diana made her first official public appearance in March 1981 in a charity event at Goldsmiths Hall . 172 173 She attended the Trooping the Colour for the first time in June 1981 making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards. In October 1981 Charles and Diana visited Wales. 26 174 She attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time on 4 November 1981. 175 Her first solo engagement was a visit to Regent Street on 18 November 1981 to switch on the Christmas lights. 176 Diana made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982 to attend the funeral of Princess Grace of Monaco . 26 Also in 1982 Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands created Diana a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown . 177 In 1983 Diana accompanied Charles and William on a tour of Australia and New Zealand.

Diana was the Regiments Colonel-in-Chief from 1992 to 1996. 302 The original plan was for Diana to be buried in the Spencer family vault at the local church in nearby Great Brington but Lord Spencer said he was concerned about public safety and security and the onslaught of visitors that might overwhelm Great Brington. He decided Diana would be buried where her grave could be easily cared for and visited in privacy by William Harry and other relatives. 303 Conspiracy theories inquest and verdict Main article: Conspiracy theories about the death of Diana Princess of Wales The initial French judicial investigation concluded that the crash was caused by Pauls intoxication reckless driving speeding and effects of prescription drugs. 304 In February 1998 Mohamed Al-Fayed father of Dodi Fayed publicly said the crash which killed his son had been planned 305 and accused MI6 and the Duke of Edinburgh. 306 An inquest which started in London in 2004 and continued in 2007 and 2008 307 attributed the crash to grossly negligent driving by Paul and to the pursuing paparazzi who forced Paul to speed into the tunnel. 308 On 7 April 2008 the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing . On the day after the final verdict of the inquest Al-Fayed announced that he would end his 10-year campaign to establish that the tragedy was murder; he said he did so for the sake of Dianas children. 309 Later events Finances Following her death Diana left a 21 million estate netting 17 million after estate taxes which were left in the hands of trustees her mother and her sister Sarah. 310 311 The will was signed in June 1993 but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him. 312 After applying personal and inheritance taxes a net estate of 12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries. 313 Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate. Each of them was left with 6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest and an estimated 10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively. 314 315 Many of Dianas possessions were initially left in the care of her brother who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Dianas sons. 314 310 They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 update raised two million dollars for charities. 310 Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels. 314 Dianas engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry respectively. William later passed the ring to his wife Catherine Middleton . Her wedding dress was also given to her sons. 314 316 317 In addition to her will 311 Diana had also written a letter of wishes in which she had asked for three-quarters of her personal property to be given to her sons and dividing the remaining quarter aside from the jewellery among her 17 godchildren. 310 Despite Dianas wishes the executors her mother and sister petitioned the probate court for a variance of the will and the letter of wishes was ignored because it did not contain certain language required by British law . 310 Eventually one item from Dianas estate was given to each of her godchildren while they would have received 100 000 each if a quarter of her estate had been divided between them. 310 The variance also delayed the distribution of her estate to her sons until they reached age 30. It had originally been set at age 25. 310 311 Diana also left her butler Paul Burrell around 50 000 in cash. 313 311 Subject of US government surveillance In 1999 after the submission of a Freedom of Information request by the Internet news service apbonline.com it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the National Security Agency until her death and the organisation kept a top secret file on her containing more than 1 000 pages. 318 319 The contents of Dianas NSA file cannot be disclosed because of national security concerns. 318 The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a target of their massive worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure. 318 Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassifiedwith one of the notable ones being filed by Mohamed Al-Fayedthe NSA has refused to release the documents. 319 In 2008 Ken Wharfe a former bodyguard of Diana claimed that her scandalous conversations with James Gilbey commonly referred to as Squidgygate were in fact recorded by the GCHQ which intentionally released them on a loop . 320 People close to Diana believed the action was intended to defame her. 320 Wharfe said Diana herself believed that members of the royal family were all being monitored though he also stated that the main reason for it could be the potential threats of the IRA . 320 Anniversaries commemorations and auctions On the first anniversary of Dianas death people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. 321 322 The royal family and Tony Blair and his family went to Crathie Kirk for private prayers while Dianas family held a private memorial service at Althorp. 323 324 All flags at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences were flown at half-mast on the Queens orders. 325 The Union Jack was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Dianas funeral and has set a precedent as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace even on the death of a monarch . 325 Since 1997 however the Union Flag but not the Royal Standard has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family and other times of national mourning. 326 Elton John performing at the Concert for Diana 2007 The Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium was held on 1 July 2007.

Ali also believed that she had a lasting influence on the public discourse particularly in matters of mental health by discussing her eating disorder publicly. 211 According to Tina Brown in her early years Diana possessed a passive power a quality that in her opinion she shared with the Queen Mother and a trait that would enable her to instinctively use her appeal to achieve her goals. 354 Diana was known for her encounters with sick and dying patients and the poor and unwanted whom she used to comfort an action that earned her more popularity. 355 Known for her easygoing attitude she reportedly hated formality in her inner circle asking people not to jump up every time she enters the room . 356 Diana is often credited with widening the range of charity works carried out by the royal family in a more modern style. 211 Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post wrote in an article that Diana imbued her role as royal princess with vitality activism and above all glamour. 21 Alicia Carroll of The New York Times described Diana as a breath of fresh air who was the main reason the royal family was known in the United States. 357 In Anthony Holden s opinion Diana was visibly reborn after her separation from Charles a point in her life that was described by Holden as her moment of triumph which put her on an independent path to success. 202 Dianas sudden death brought an unprecedented spasm of grief and mourning 358 and subsequently a crisis arose in the Royal Household. 359 360 361 Andrew Marr said that by her death she revived the culture of public sentiment . 211 Her son William has stated that the outpouring of public grief after her death changed the British psyche for the better while Alastair Campbell noted that it assisted in diminishing the stiff upper lip approach . 362 In 1997 Diana was one of the runners-up for Time magazines Person of the Year 363 and in 2020 the magazine included Dianas name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was chosen as the Woman of the Year 1987 for her efforts in destigmatising the conditions surrounding HIVAIDS patients. 364 In 2002 Diana ranked third on the BBC s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons above the Queen and other British monarchs. 365 Despite being regarded as an iconic figure and a popular member of the royal family Diana was subject to criticism during her life. 344 She was criticised by philosophy professor Anthony OHear who in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy and she was self-indulgent in her philanthropic efforts. 276 Following his remarks charity organisations that were supported by Diana defended her and Peter Luff called OHears comments distasteful and inappropriate . 276 Further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself 120 which in return demeaned her royal office . 344 Dianas unique type of charity work which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases occasionally had a negative reaction in the media. 344 Dianas relationship with the press and the paparazzi has been described as ambivalent . On different occasions she would complain about the way she was being treated by the media mentioning that their constant presence in her proximity had made life impossible for her whereas at other times she would seek their attention and hand information to reporters herself. 366 367 Writing for The Guardian Peter Conrad suggested that it was Diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew they were the source of her power. 368 This view was supported by Christopher Hitchens who believed that in pursuit of a personal solution to an unhappy private life she became an assiduous leaker to the press . 369 Tina Brown argued that Diana was in no way a vulnerable victim of media manipulation and she found it offensive to present the canny resourceful Diana as a woman of no agency . 65 Former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman who later hacked the phones of Dianas sons on several occasions stated in a court in 2014 that in 1992 Diana sent a confidential directory which contained numbers of senior members of the royal household to their office to get back at Prince Charles. 370 Nevertheless Diana also used the medias interest in her to shine light on her charitable efforts and patronages. 366 Sally Bedell Smith characterised Diana as unpredictable egocentric and possessive. 120 Smith also argued that in her desire to do charity works Diana was motivated by personal considerations rather than by an ambitious urge to take on a societal problem . 120 Eugene Robinson however said that Diana was serious about the causes she espoused . 21 According to Sarah Bradford Diana looked down on the House of Windsor whom she reportedly viewed as jumped-up foreign princelings and called them the Germans . 368 Tony Blair characterised Diana as a manipulative person and extraordinarily captivating . 345 359 371 In an article written for The Independent in 1998 journalist Yvonne Roberts observed the sudden change in peoples opinion of Diana after her death from critical to complimentary a viewpoint supported by Theodore Dalrymple who also noticed the sudden shift . 372 Roberts also added that Diana was neither a saint nor a revolutionary figure but may have encouraged some people to tackle issues such as landmines AIDS and leprosy. 373 While analysing the impact of Dianas death and her popularity from a gendered point of view the British historian Ludmilla Jordanova said no human being can survive the complex forces that impact upon charismatic women. Jordanova also observed that it is Better to remember her by trying to decipher how emotions overshadow analysis and why women are the safeguards of humanitarian feelings. 348 The author Anne Applebaum believed that Diana had not had any impact on public opinions posthumously; 211 an idea supported by Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian who believed that Dianas memory and influence started to fade away in the years after her death 374 while Peter Conrad another Guardian contributor argued that even in a decade after her death she is still not silent 368 and Allan Massie of The Telegraph believed that Dianas sentiments continue to shape our society . 375 Writing for The Guardian Monica Ali described Diana as fascinating and flawed. Her legacy might be mixed but its not insubstantial. Her life was brief but she left her mark . 211 Fashion and style Main article: Fashion of Diana Princess of Wales Wearing the Travolta dress one of her most famous ensembles November 1985 Diana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world. In 2012 Time included Diana on its All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list. 376 Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: Diana had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them. 377 378 An early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with Charles in 1980 when sales of Hunter Wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate. 377 379 According to designers and people who worked with Diana she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes express herself and communicate. 380 381 382 Diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style impacting recent cultural and style trends. 383 384 336 385 The princesss fashion combined classically royal expectations with contemporary fashion trends in Britain. 386 387 While on diplomatic trips her clothes and attire were chosen to match the destination countries costumes and while off-duty she used to wear loose jackets and jumpers. 384 388 She was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted it was something that really mattered to her according to Anna Harvey a former British Vogue editor and Dianas fashion mentor. 384 389 Her fashion sense originally incorporated decorous and romantic elements with pastel shades and lush gowns. 387 390 391 Elements of her fashion rapidly became trends. 384 She forwent certain traditions such as wearing gloves during engagements and sought to create a wardrobe that helped her to connect with the public. 382 388 According to Donatella Versace who worked closely with Diana alongside her brother Dianas interest and sense of curiosity about fashion grew significantly after her marital separation. 380 Her style subsequently grew bolder and more businesslike featuring structured skirt suits sculptural gowns and neutral tones designed to reflect attention toward her charity work. 383 392 Catherine Walker was among Dianas favourite designers 387 with whom she worked to create her royal uniform . 393 Among her favoured designers were Versace Armani Chanel Dior Gucci and Clarks . 384 385 394 Her famous outfits include the Black Sheep Sweater 395 396 the Revenge dress which she wore after Charless admission of adultery 397 and the Travolta dress . 384 393 387 Copies of Dianas British Vogue -featured pink chiffon blouse by David and Elizabeth Emanuel which appeared in the magazine on her engagement announcement day sold in the millions. 387 She appeared on three British Vogue covers during her lifetime and was featured on its October 1997 issue posthumously. 398 Diana did her own makeup for events and was accompanied by a hairstylist for public appearances. 380 In the 1990s she was frequently photographed clutching distinctive handbags manufactured by Gucci and Dior which became known as the Gucci Diana and Lady Dior . 399 400 Following the opening of an exhibition of Dianas clothes and dresses at Kensington Palace in 2017 Catherine Bennett of The Guardian said such exhibitions are among the suitable ways to commemorate public figures whose fashion styles were noted due to their achievements. The exhibition suggests to detractors who like many other princesses looking lovely in different clothes was pretty much her lifes work which also brings interest in her clothing. 401 Versace also pointed out that she doesnt think that anyone before or after her has done for fashion what Diana did . 380 One of Dianas favourite milliners John Boyd said Diana was our best ambassador for hats and the entire millinery industry owes her a debt. Boyds pink tricorn hat Diana wore for her honeymoon was later copied by milliners across the world and credited with rebooting an industry in decline for decades. 402 403 Memorials Memorial in Harrods Department Store to Diana and Fayed Tribute to Diana on 1998 Azerbaijan postage stamps Tributes left outside Kensington Palace for what would have been Dianas 60th birthday Permanent memorials to Diana include the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park London ; 404 the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Playground in Kensington Gardens; 405 the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk a circular path between Kensington Gardens Green Park Hyde Park and St. Jamess Park ; 406 the Diana Memorial Award established in 1999 and later relaunched in 2007 by Gordon Brown; 407 the Statue of Diana Princess of Wales in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace; 408 and the Princess Diana Memorial in the garden of Schloss Cobenzl in Vienna making it the first memorial dedicated to Diana in a German-speaking country. 409 The Flame of Liberty was erected in 1989 on the Place de lAlma in Paris above the entrance to the tunnel in which the fatal crash later occurred.
