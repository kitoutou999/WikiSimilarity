He later performed the song Takeover at Summer Jam 2001 which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson . 52 A line at the end of Takeover referred to Nas who criticized him on We Will Survive . 53 Nas responded with a diss of his own and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to Takeover which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers.

The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S. 47 and surpassing The Blueprint . 62 It yielded a single-disc re-issue The Blueprint 2.1 which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles Excuse Me Miss and 03 Bonnie Clyde which features Jay-Zs then-girlfriend Beyonce and contained the track A Dream featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G. ; the re-issue spawned the single La-La-La which was a sequel to Excuse Me Miss and failed to match its commercial success. 20032005: The Black Album and initial retirement Jay-Z in 2003 After visiting the south of France 63 Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album The Black Album at the opening of the 4040 Club. 64 He worked with several producers including Just Blaze The Neptunes Kanye West Timbaland Eminem DJ Quik 9th Wonder The Buchanans and Rick Rubin .

The concert was entitled the I Declare War concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously declared war on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals. 69 The theme of the concert was Jay-Zs position as president and CEO of Def Jam complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office . Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists as well as Ne-Yo Teairra Mari T.I. Young Jeezy Akon Kanye West Paul Wall The LOX and Diddy . 70 At the conclusion of the concert Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans.

Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. Im sorry but Jay-Z? Gallagher asked swearing. No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of kind of guitar music do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday nightyou go Kylie Minogue? I dont know about that do you know what I mean?but Im not having hip hop at Glastonbury no way no no. Its wrong. 83 As controversy mounted Jay-Z replied We dont play guitars Noel but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression.
