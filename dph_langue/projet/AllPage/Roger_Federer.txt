Federer has huge popularity in the world of sport and is considered by many to be the greatest tennis player of all time. Between 2009 and 2018 many players and analysts considered him to be the greatest player ever. b He was also called the greatest athlete of his generation by some sports reporters after he won his 19th and 20th major titles. 348 349 In 2005 Rod Laver described Federer as an unbelievable talent capable of anything and that he could be the greatest tennis player of all time . 350 When he finally won the French Open in 2009 former world No. 1s Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras both hailed him as the greatest player that played the game . 351 352 Federer himself has downplayed these claims stating in 2012 that it is impossible to compare tennis players from different eras and that past champions are needed to pave the way for future champions. 353 In 2014 Frank Sedgman ranked Federer number two behind Jack Kramer in his greatest male tennis players of all-time list in his autobiography Game Sedge and Match. 354 In 2018 Tennis.com listed him as the greatest male player of the Open Era. 355 In May 2020 the Tennis Channel ranked Federer as the greatest male tennis player of all time. 356 In May 2021 Serena Williams described Federer as a genius and the greatest . 357 In July 2021 BBC Sport users picked Federer as the greatest male tennis player of all time. 358 During an interview with LEquipe in July 2021 Richard Gasquet said aesthetics and grace are more important than the number of Grand Slam titles when it comes to deciding who is the greatest.

One at 21 the other at 22 or 23. I dont just see the Grand Slam winner I look at the aesthetics what you give off on the court. I often hear the race to the highest it is a pointless subject. For me Roger Federer is irreplaceable hes the greatest player of all time when I see the aesthetics the grace he has on the court. Richard Gasquet on Federers lasting legacy in July 2021 360 Federer helped to lead a revival in tennis known by many as the Golden Age leading to increased interest in the sport and higher revenues for many tennis venues. Rising revenues led to exploding prize money: When Federer first won the Australian Open in 2004 he earned 985 000. When he won in 2018 the prize had increased to AUD 4 million. 361 Player profile Playing style Federers versatility has been described by Jimmy Connors as follows: In an era of specialists youre either a clay court specialist a grass court specialist or a hard court specialist... or youre Roger Federer. 362 Federer serving at the Australian Open in 2014 An elite athlete Federer was an all-court all-around player known for his speed fluid style of play and exceptional shot-making. Federer mainly played from the baseline but was also comfortable at the net being one of the best volleyers in the game. 363 He had a powerful accurate smash very effectively performed rare elements of professional tennis such as the backhand smash and skyhook half-volley jump smash slam dunk and an aggressive serve return known affectionately as SABR Sneak Attack By Roger a half-volley attack on an opponents second serve. The writer David Foster Wallace compared the brute force of Federers forehand motion with that of a great liquid whip 364 while John McEnroe referred to Federers forehand as the greatest shot in our sport . 365 Federer played with a single-handed backhand which gave him great variety. He employed the slice occasionally using it to lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer could also fire topspin winners and possessed a flick backhand with which he could generate pace with his wrist; the flick backhand was usually used to pass opponents who came to the net. 364 He averaged 90 of service games won throughout his career often coming up victorious in clutch or pressure service games. His serve was difficult to read as he always used a similar ball toss regardless of what type of serve he was going to hit and where he aimed to hit it. He was often able to produce big serves on key points in a match. His first serve averaged about 200 kmh 125 mph 366 367 368 but he was capable of serving at 220 kmh 137 mph. 366 367 Federer was also accomplished at serve and volleying 369 and employed this tactic frequently in his early career. 370 371 Later in his career Federer added the drop shot to his arsenal and could perform a well-disguised drop shot off both wings. He sometimes used a between-the-legs shot which is colloquially referred to as a tweener or hotdog . His most notable use of the tweener was in the semifinals of the 2009 US Open against Novak Djokovic bringing him triple match point. 372 Federer is one of the top players who successfully employed the squash shot . After Stefan Edberg joined his coaching team at the start of the 2014 season Federer played a more offensive game attacking the net more often and improving his volleys. 373 374 In the lead-up to the 2015 US Open Federer successfully added a new unique shot to his arsenal called SABR Sneak Attack by Roger in which he charged forward to receive a second serve and hit a return on the service line. 375 With the switch to a bigger 97-inch racket from a 90-inch racquet Federer gained easier serving and better defense on both wings with fewer shanks; however he experienced diminished control and power on his forehand slice backhand and dropshot. 376 Demeanor and attitude Federer was noted for his cool demeanor and emotional control on the court. Most of his professional game has been characterized by a lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors giving him an advantage over less controlled opponents. 377 378 379 In 2016 Federer declared: I dont get the anxiety during a match so much anymore. You know to throw racquets to toss balls out of the court scream and stuff. I almost laugh on the inside about it a little bit today when an opponent does it. But thats something for me thats not a problem anymore. 380 Originally lacking self-control as a junior 6 he transformed his on-court demeanor 7 to become well-liked for his graciousness. Despite clearly possessing talent from a young age Federer tended to allow his emotions to get the best of him causing his game to falter. On some occasions this emotional state escalated into counter-productive actions such as racket abuse. 37 Rarely a day went by when he would not throw his racquet against the fence in his search to play the perfect game . Federer later confessed to having been a hot head at a young age as he often erupted if he hit a dumb shot. 17 Despite this fragile temperament Federer still impressed his then-coach Adolf Kacovsky who said that during defeats he never gave up and was willing to learn from his mistakes afterwards. 17 By the time he became professional Federer had learned to temper his emotions but still he struggled to adapt to the work ethic and compromising mindset needed to be a competitive professional player. 37 In 2007 Rod Laver described him as follows: One thing is for sure: hes the best player of his time and one of the most admirable champions on the planet. Thats certainly something worth crowing over. The beauty is Roger Federer wont . 381 Coaches From ages 8 to 10 Federer received group and individual training from veteran Czech coach Adolf Kacovsky. 17 Reflecting on Federer Kacovsky said The private lessons which were partly funded by the club. Roger was a quick learner. When you wanted to teach him something new he was able to pick it up after three or four tries while others in the group needed weeks . 17 At age 10 Federer began working with Peter Carter . Between the ages of 10 and 14 Federer spent more time with Carter than with his own family working daily on all aspects of his game. Building on the work done earlier by Kacovsky Carter helped perfect Federers technique along with teaching him the strategy and psychology required to play the game to a high level. 17 Federer has credited Carter for his entire technique and coolness . 17 In 1999 when Federer decided to play full-time on the ATP tour he chose Peter Lundgren rather than Carter as his traveling coach and they worked together until the end of 2003 before finally splitting. 33 On 1 August 2002 Carter died in a car crash in South Africa . According to his autobiography when Federer heard the news of Carters death he was never so upset in his life while an Australian newspaper reported that when Federer heard the news he left his hotel and ran through the streets bawling and hysterical . 382 About Carters funeral Federer stated: Any defeat in tennis is nothing compared to such a moment . 54 His death had a deep impact on Federer who would even call it a wake-up call before winning his first major in the following year Wimbledon which he dedicated to Carter. 54 383 384 Federers playing style has been greatly influenced by his coaches over the years. For instance he has credited his infamous SABR technique to his coach Severin Luthi who encouraged him to develop it and use it in big matches. 385 His other coaches were Tony Roche 20052007 Severin Luthi 20072022 Jose Higueras 2008 Paul Annacone 20102013 Stefan Edberg 20142015 and Ivan Ljubicic 20162022. 386 Equipment Federer began the 2014 season by changing rackets for the first time in his career. He switched from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches. He had long been at a comparative disadvantage in equipment to almost the entire tour including his top rivals Nadal and Djokovic who used more powerful frames of between 95 and 100 square inches. 387 388 After that Federer played with his signature Wilson Pro Staff RF97 Autograph racquet. It had a 97 square inch head 16x19 string pattern 366 gram strung weight 340 gram swing weight 68 RA stiffness and 9 point head light balance. 389 Federer strings his racquets using Wilson Natural Gut 16 gauge for his main strings and Luxilon ALU Power Rough 17 gauge polyester for his cross strings. In an interview in November 2017 Federer stated his favorite stringing tension is 26.5 kilograms 58.4 lb mains 25 kilograms 55.1 lb crosses. 390 As a junior player Federer played with a Wilson Pro Staff 6.0 85 square inch head racquet. He switched to a bigger custom-built Wilson 90 square inch head racquet in 2003. 391 392 His grip size was 4 3 8 inches L3. 393 When asked about string tensions Federer stated this depends on how warm the days are and with what kind of balls I play and against who I play. So you can see it depends on several factors and not just the surface; the feeling I have is most important. 394 Apparel Federer first signed with Nike footwear and apparel in 1994. 395 For the 2006 championships at Wimbledon Nike designed a jacket emblazoned with a crest of three tennis racquets symbolising the three Wimbledon Championships he had previously won and which was updated the next year with four racquets after he won the Championship in 2006. 396 At Wimbledon 2008 and again in 2009 Nike continued this trend by making him a personalised cardigan that also had his own logo an R and an F joined 397 398 which was originally designed by his wife Mirka. 399 Federers contract with Nike expired in March 2018 and he later signed a deal with Uniqlo . 400 It was reported that Uniqlo signed Federer for roughly 300 million for 10 years 30 million per year as opposed to Nikes previous deal with Federer which was reportedly for roughly 10 million per year. 401 Since 2021 Federer has worn tennis shoes produced by On a Swiss-based athletic shoe and sports apparel manufacturer in which he became a shareholder in November 2019.
