On his fathers side he is of Italian and Spanish descent the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy and on his mothers side he has primarily Italian ancestry. 3 Growing up in a tight-knit football-loving family Leo developed a passion for the sport from an early age playing constantly with his older brothers Rodrigo and Matias and his cousins Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi both of whom became professional footballers. 22 At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli where he was coached by his father though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother Celia who accompanied him to training and matches. 23 He was greatly affected by her death shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then as a devout Catholic he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother. 24 25 Youth career Newells Old Boys 19952000 When you saw him you would think: this kid cant play ball. Hes a dwarf hes too fragile too small. But immediately youd realise that he was born different that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive. Newells Old Boys youth coach Adrian Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi. 26 A lifelong supporter of Newells Old Boys Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newells he scored almost 500 goals as a member of The Machine of 87 the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first teams home games. 27 28 29 His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo with Messi calling him the best forward Ive ever seen . 30 However his future as a professional player was threatened when aged 10 he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency . As his fathers health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy which cost at least 1 000 per month Newells agreed to contribute but later reneged on their promise. 31 He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. 32 33 It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health however in a 2019 interview Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. 34 Barcelona 20002004 Messi enrolled at Barcelonas youth academy La Masia aged 13. As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment and Rexach with no other paper at hand offered a contract on a paper napkin. 32 35 In February 2001 the family relocated to Barcelona where they moved into an apartment near the clubs stadium Camp Nou . During his first year in Spain Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newells; as a foreigner he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister Maria Sol while he stayed in Barcelona with his father. 27 35 36 After a year at Barcelonas youth academy La Masia Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation RFEF in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions he befriended his teammates among whom were Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique . 37 After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14 38 Messi became an integral part of the Baby Dream Team Barcelonas greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season 200203 he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. 37 39 The Copa Catalunya final a 41 victory over Espanyol became known in club lore as the partido de la mascara the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. 40 At the close of the season he received an offer to join Arsenal his first from a foreign club but while Fabregas and Pique soon left for England he chose to remain in Barcelona. 35 41 42 Messi continued to progress through the clubs ranks at a rapid pace debuting for four youth teams during the 200304 season. 43 After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juvenil B he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juvenil A where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. 44 45 Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard s first team: He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the teams starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien. 46 It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life. Barcelonas then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messis first-team debut. 47 At 16 years four months and 23 days old Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against Jose Mourinho s Porto on 16 November 2003. 35 48 His performance creating two chances and a shot on goal impressed the technical staff and he subsequently began training daily with the clubs reserve side Barcelona B as well as weekly with the first team. 49 After his first training session with the senior squad Barcas new star player Ronaldinho told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself. 50 Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi whom he called little brother which greatly eased his transition into the first team. 51 52 To gain further match experience Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juvenil A playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera Division scoring five goals in ten games including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla s Sergio Ramos . 44 53 His progress was reflected in his first professional contract signed on 4 February 2004 which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of 30 million. A month later on 6 March he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda Division B and his buyout clause automatically increased to 80 million. 44 54 He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. 55 Physically he was weaker than his opponents who were often much older and taller and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season he returned to both youth teams helping the Juvenil B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions. 44 53 Club career Main article: Career of Lionel Messi Club career Barcelona 20042021 20042008: Rise to the first team Messi pictured in 2005 at the age of 18 playing for FC Barcelona where he played for 17 years.

Due to his short stature Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players which gives him greater agility allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; 219 220 this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atomica The Atomic Flea . 221 222 223 Despite being physically unimposing he possesses significant upper-body strength which combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. 27 220 224 His short strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. 225 His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it. 226 Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot he usually begins dribbling runs while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists. 227 228 A prolific goalscorer Messi is known for his finishing positioning quick reactions and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role courtesy of his vision and range of passing. 229 He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. 230 231 232 Moreover he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. 220 233 As of September 2023 Messi ranks fifth all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65 234 the most among active players. 235 He also has a penchant for scoring from chips . 236 Messis dribbling abilities allow him to weave past several defenders and orchestrate attacking plays. Messis pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal in particular during counterattacks usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. 224 233 237 He is widely considered to be one of the greatest dribblers of all time. 238 239 With regard to this ability his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him The ball stays glued to his foot; Ive seen great players in my career but Ive never seen anyone with Messis ball control. 228 Beyond his individual qualities he is also a well-rounded hard-working team player known for his creative combinations in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta . 219 220 As his career advanced and his athleticism and tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. 240 241 242 His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed he was able to improve his efficiency movement and positional play and was also able to avoid muscular injuries despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed while he was injury-prone in his early career he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball and by adopting a stricter diet training regime and sleep schedule. 243 Tactical positioning A versatile forward Messi often plays as a classic number 10 . Tactically Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers known as the enganche in Argentine football but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward . 244 Upon his first-team debut he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard ; from this position he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. 226 Under Guardiola and subsequent managers he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker he would roam the centre often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him in order to create and exploit spaces for passes other teammates attacking runs off the ball Messis own dribbling runs or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. 36 Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the managers 433 formation 245 246 while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper free playmaking role in later seasons. 247 248 Under manager Ernesto Valverde Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role from which he could make runs from behind into the box 249 or even on the right wing 250 or as a false nine 251 252 he was also used in a more offensive central role in a 4231 248 or as a second striker in a 442 formation where he was once again given the licence to drop deep link-up with midfielders orchestrate his teams attacking plays and create chances for his attacking partner Luis Suarez . 253 254 With the Argentina national team Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline. Under various managers he has been employed on the right wing as a false nine as an out-and-out striker in a supporting role alongside another forward or in a deeper free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers. 255 256 Reception Messi is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation alongside Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo . 257 A prodigious talent as a teenager Messi established himself among the worlds best players before age 20. 258 Shortly after teammate Ronaldinho won the 2005 Ballon dOr he commented Im not even the best at Barca in reference to his 18-year-old protege. 259 Four years later after Messi had won his first Ballon dOr by a record margin 78 the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. 23 224 260 An early proponent was his then- Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola who as early as August 2009 declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. 261 In the following years this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits managers former and current players 89 262 and by the end of Barcas second treble-winning season the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. 263 264 He initially received dismissals by critics based on the fact that he had not won an international tournament at senior level with Argentina. 265 266 267 However Messis subsequent victories in the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 FIFA World Cup resulted in him finally winning every top tier trophy at both the club and country levels an achievement that many pundits felt cemented his legacy. 268 Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo Main article: MessiRonaldo rivalry Messi has been compared with Cristiano Ronaldo left throughout much of their careers. Among his contemporary peers Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Cristiano Ronaldo who many consider his career rival . 257 Both achieved numerous individual accolades won dozens of trophies for both club and country and are the two leading goal scorers in history . Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry 269 270 they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. 271 Pundits have compared the ongoing rivalry to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing the ProstSenna rivalry in motorsport and the tennis rivalries between FedererNadal and BorgMcEnroe . 272 Fans and pundits alike regularly argue the individual merits of both players. 271 273 Messi is lauded for his combination of dribbling playmaking passing and goalscoring while Ronaldo has received praise for his exceptional speed and athleticism goalscoring skills and performance under pressure. 274 275 Beyond their playing styles the debate also revolves around their differing physiques Ronaldo is 1.87 m 6 ft 1 1 2 in with a muscular build compared to Messis smaller size and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldos self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messis humility. 276 Regarding individual achievements Messi has won eight Ballons dOr to Ronaldos five 277 eight FIFA Worlds Best Player awards to Ronaldos five and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldos four. 278 Off the pitch Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary sponsorships and social media fanbase. 279 Messis head-to-head record against teams that feature Ronaldo consists of 15 wins 9 draws and 10 losses in competitive club matches 1 win and 1 loss in international friendlies and 1 win in a club friendly. The first competitive matchup between the two occurred in 2008 when Ronaldos Manchester United were drawn to play Messis Barcelona in the 200708 UEFA Champions League semi-finals where Manchester United would eventually advance 10 on aggregate. 280 The two teams and subsequently the two players would meet in the Champions League again the next year this time in the final with this time Messi and Barcelona being the victors after a 20 result. 281 After this Ronaldo would transfer to Real Madrid the main rivals of Barcelona and from 200910 to 201718 Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clasico which ranks among the worlds most viewed annual sports events. 282 279 Ronaldos would then transfer to Juventus in the summer of 2018; their final matchup in a competitive match would occur during a 202021 UEFA Champions League group stage match where Ronaldos two goals from the penalty spot helped Juventus to a 30 victory against Messis Barcelona. 283 After Ronaldo left Real Madrid for Juventus Messi stated: I miss Cristiano. Although it was a bit difficult to see him win trophies he gave La Liga prestige. 284 Following Messi leading Argentina to victory in the 2022 World Cup a number of football critics commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players. 285 286 Comparisons with Diego Maradona Main article: New Maradona I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi. Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006. 287 Throughout his career Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona who was also considered the best player of his generation and one of greatest in the history of the sport. 288 289 This was due to their short statures their similar playing styles as diminutive left-footed playmakers and the fact that they both came from Argentina. 290 Initially Messi was merely one of many young Argentine players to receive the New Maradona moniker but as his career progressed Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders establishing himself as the best player Argentina had produced since Maradona. 33 291 Even when Messi was 18 years old Maradona called him the best player in the world and hailed him as his successor. 287 Maradona and Messi would work together as manager and player for Argentinas national side from 2008 through the 2010 FIFA World Cup the former thoroughly impressed with the latters skills. 292 During this period Messi was given Argentinas number 10 shirt that Maradona famously wore with Maradona telling him: the No 10 is yours. Theres nobody better than you to wear it. 293 Jorge Valdano who won the World Cup with Maradona said in October 2013 Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico. 294 Cesar Menotti who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays at the level of the best Maradona . 295 Other notable Argentines in the sport such as Diego Simeone and Javier Zanetti expressed their belief between 201213 that Messi had already overtaken Maradona as the best player in the nations history. 296 297 Due to their similar size and style of play Messi was constantly compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona by pundits and his countrymen. During the early and middle parts of his career Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona in Argentine society. Part of this had to do with Messis lack of tournament success and perceived uneven output with the national team during this period Maradona had famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 FIFA World Cup with a dominant overall performance which set expectations for Messi to do the same. 265 288 298 Also unlike Maradona Messi never played in the Argentine Primera Division therefore depriving his countrymen a chance to watch him develop and prove himself and through no fault of his own would do this overseas in La Liga instead. 27 298 His lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt early tendency not to sing the national anthem and disinclination to emotional displays have in the past led to the false perception that he felt more Catalan rather than truly Argentine. 194 299 However despite having lived in Barcelona since age 13 Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally saying: Argentina is my country my family my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy. 300 Another factor for the Argentine preference for Maradona over Messi was the differences between the two in personality class and background. Maradona was an extroverted fiery and controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums all character traits that many Argentines identified as being representative of their national values. 267 288 In contrast Messi could be seen as the antithesis of his predecessor: introverted reserved and unassuming with a comparably unremarkable upbringing in Rosario. 298 301 Several pundits and footballing figures would point to this temperament to question Messis leadership capabilities for the national team especially in contrast to Maradonas. 265 302 Maradona himself once echoed these sentiments stating that he did not believe that Messi had the personality to be a leader. 303 When reflecting on the expectations that Messi faced in comparison to Maradona throughout his career compatriot Osvaldo Ardiles stated: Messi has always lived in the shadow of Diego Maradona the leader of our last World Cup-winning team in 1986. He could never escape the similarities. They are both No. 10s both the best players in the world both left footed and both capable of magical extraordinary moments. And yet they were very different in terms of personality ... people were always looking for a leader like Maradona and Messi wasnt that person. 304 The Sistine Chapel of Football painting Messi to the left Maradona to the right on the ceiling of a sports club Sportivo Pereyra in Barracas Buenos Aires . Football journalist Tim Vickery stated the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019 with Messi making a conscious effort to become more one of the group more Argentine . 299 Other pundits noted that Messi had grown more assertive as a leader during the 2019 Copa America by becoming more vocal with his teammates both on and off the pitch finally singing the national anthem with the team before matches and speaking with journalists at length after matches the latter of which he rarely did for Barcelona. 305 The red card he was shown after a shoving match during the third-place match and subsequent outburst during the post-game conference where he criticized the organization of the tournament were cited as examples of Messis new mindset. 306 Longtime Argentina teammate Angel Di Maria said that despite the tournament ending in a loss and continuing Argentinas long trophy drought it revealed a new Messi leading the national team. 307 A mural featuring both Maradona and Messi following Argentinas World Cup win in 2022 . Following the World Cup win for Messi and Argentina Vickery felt that Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona. 299 In addition to Messis output of goals and assists throughout the tournament Valdano saw an edge to Messis performances which he described as a Maradonian streak. 308 Ardiles highlighted Messi provoking the Netherlands side during the semi-final particularly when he goaded the opposing bench after scoring a penalty and snapped at one of the Dutch players during the post-game conference. Stating that these actions were very unlike Messi but more of a Maradona reaction Ardiles believed that they resulted in Messi further endearing himself to his countrymen. 304 Messi himself later remarked that the World Cup victory won over all the people of Argentina. Today 95 or 100 of Argentines love me and thats a beautiful feeling. 309 In popular culture Messi was the worlds highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the 40 million benchmark with earnings of 41 million in 2013 and the 5060 million points with income of 65 million in 2014. 310 311 Messi was second on Forbes list of the worlds highest-paid athletes after Ronaldo with income of 81 million from salary and endorsements in 201516. 312 In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the 100m benchmark for a calendar year with earnings of 126m 154m in combined income from salaries bonuses and endorsements. 313 Forbes ranked him the worlds highest-paid athlete in 2019. 314 From 2008 he was Barcelonas highest-paid player receiving a salary that increased incrementally from 7.8 million to 13 million over the next five years. 315 316 106 Signing a new contract in 2017 he earned 667 000 per week in wages and Barcelona paid him 60 million as a signing on bonus. 317 His buyout clause was set at 835 million 700 million. 317 In 2020 Messi became the second footballer as well as the second athlete in a team sport after Ronaldo to surpass 1 billion in earnings during their careers. 318 Messis success on the pitch earned him several lucrative endorsement deals and a large social media following.

As a commercial entity Messis brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham . At the start of his career he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing such as Adidas Pepsi and Konami . 343 344 From 2010 concurrently with increased achievements as a player his marketing appeal widened leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce Gabbana and Audemars Piguet . 343 345 Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette Turkish Airlines Ooredoo and Tata Motors among other companies. 346 347 348 349 Messi was the face of Konamis video game series Pro Evolution Soccer appearing on the covers of PES 2009 PES 2010 PES 2011 and PES 2020 .

It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends. 354 Philanthropy Throughout his career Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004 he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. 355 356 Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010 completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the countrys children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake .

He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. 369 370 In February 2021 Messi donated to the Museu Nacional dArt de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pele s record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for 125 000. 371 In advance of the 2021 Copa America Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messiin order to secure 50 000 doses of Sinovacs COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac in the hope of vaccinating all of South Americas football players. 372 A deal brokered by Uruguays president Luis Lacalle Pou the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandu Orsi remarking that Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa America he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones . 372 Public art One of many street arts depicting Messi. Murals and street art depicting Messi are regularly painted across the globe. 373 374 One prominent artwork that went viral is the Sistine Chapel of Football a parody of Leonardo Da Vinci s The Creation of Adam that features both Messi and Diego Maradona along with several other prominent Argentine footballers. The work is exhibited at the Sportivo Pereyra club from Barracas in Buenos Aires . 375 Several public sculptures with Messis likeness have been erected as well. Madame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. 376 After the announcement of his first retirement from the international team in June 2016 a bronze statue of Messi was erected in Buenos Aires days later in an attempt to convince him to return. 377 A life-sized statue of Messi holding the World Cup trophy was unveiled outside the CONMEBOL headquarters in Luque Paraguay on March 2023 a few months after Argentinas World Cup win. The statue would stand alongside those of Pele and Diego Maradona. 378 Business ventures On June 4 2024 Messi announced the release of Mas an American brand of sports and energy drinks . 379 Messi created the drink because he couldnt find a flavorful and healthy hydration option that suited his needs. 380 The drink was teased to debut in Miami Florida on June 13 2024. It was released in Publix and Walmart stores and made available for delivery on Gopuff in South Florida the following day. 379 Mas is affiliated with White Claw Hard Seltzer founder Mark Anthony. 381 Later that year on September 19 2024 Messi announced that he would be launching a production company called 525 Rosario named after his hometown. Headquartered in Miami and Los Angeles the company was created to produce film sporting events and branded commercials for athletes worldwide. It would be a joint venture with Smuggler Entertainment who produced the Apple TV docuseries Messis World Cup: The Rise of a Legend earlier in 2024. 382 Personal life Family and relationships Since 2008 Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo who he eventually married on 30 June 2017 in their hometown of Rosario . 383 384 He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend Lucas Scaglia who is also a football player. 385 After keeping their relationship private for a year Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009 before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the BarcelonaEspanyol derby. 386 Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partners first pregnancy Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentinas 40 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012 before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. 387 Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. 388 In April 2015 Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. 389 In October 2017 his wife announced they were expecting their third child. 390 Messi and his family are Catholic . 391 Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members particularly his mother Celia whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father Jorge has been his agent since he was 14 and his oldest brother Rodrigo handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother Matias manage his charitable organization the Leo Messi Foundation and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario. 392 Since leaving for Spain aged 13 Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent . He has kept ownership of his familys old house although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family spent the night with them and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario most of whom were fellow members of The Machine of 87 at Newells Old Boys. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona but by 2012 their public feud had ended with Newells embracing their ties with Messi even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. 27 360 393 Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newells. 394 Messi holds triple citizenship as he is a citizen of Argentina Italy and Spain. 395 Tax fraud Messis financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion . Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade 4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme voluntarily paid arrears of 5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016 Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay 1.7 million and 1.4 million in fines. 396 Facing the judge he said I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things. 397 Career statistics Club As of match played 5 October 2024 Appearances and goals by club season and competition Club Season League National cup a Continental b Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Barcelona C 200304 398 Tercera Division 10 5 10 5 Barcelona B 200304 399 Segunda Division B 5 0 5 0 200405 400 Segunda Division B 17 6 17 6 Total 22 6 22 6 Barcelona 200405 400 La Liga 7 1 1 0 1 0 9 1 200506 401 La Liga 17 6 2 1 6 1 0 0 25 8 200607 402 La Liga 26 14 2 2 5 1 3 c 0 36 17 200708 403 La Liga 28 10 3 0 9 6 40 16 200809 404 La Liga 31 23 8 6 12 9 51 38 200910 405 La Liga 35 34 3 1 11 8 4 d 4 53 47 201011 406 La Liga 33 31 7 7 13 12 2 e 3 55 53 201112 407 La Liga 37 50 7 3 11 14 5 f 6 60 73 201213 408 La Liga 32 46 5 4 11 8 2 e 2 50 60 201314 409 La Liga 31 28 6 5 7 8 2 e 0 46 41 201415 410 La Liga 38 43 6 5 13 10 57 58 201516 411 La Liga 33 26 5 5 7 6 4 g 4 49 41 201617 412 La Liga 34 37 7 5 9 11 2 e 1 52 54 201718 413 La Liga 36 34 6 4 10 6 2 e 1 54 45 201819 414 La Liga 34 36 5 3 10 12 1 e 0 50 51 201920 415 La Liga 33 25 2 2 8 3 1 e 1 44 31 202021 416 La Liga 35 30 5 3 6 5 1 e 0 47 38 Total 520 474 80 56 149 120 29 22 778 672 Paris Saint-Germain 202122 417 Ligue 1 26 6 1 0 7 5 34 11 202223 418 Ligue 1 32 16 1 0 7 4 1 h 1 41 21 Total 58 22 2 0 14 9 1 1 75 32 Inter Miami 2023 MLS 6 1 1 0 7 i 10 14 11 2024 MLS 18 17 3 j 2 0 0 21 19 Total 24 18 1 0 3 2 7 10 35 30 Career total 634 525 83 56 166 131 37 33 920 745 Includes Copa del Rey Coupe de France U.S. Open Cup All appearances in UEFA Champions League unless otherwise noted One appearance in UEFA Super Cup two appearances in Supercopa de Espana One appearance in UEFA Super Cup one appearance and two goals in Supercopa de Espana two appearances and two goals in FIFA Club World Cup a b c d e f g h Appearances in Supercopa de Espana One appearance and one goal in UEFA Super Cup two appearances and three goals in Supercopa de Espana two appearances and two goals in FIFA Club World Cup One appearance and two goals in UEFA Super Cup two appearances and one goal in Supercopa de Espana one appearance and one goal in FIFA Club World Cup Appearance in Trophee des Champions Appearances in Leagues Cup Appearances in CONCACAF Champions Cup International See also: List of international goals scored by Lionel Messi As of match played 10 October 2024 Appearances and goals by national team year and competition Team Year Competitive Friendly Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Argentina U20 181 419 2004 2 3 2 3 2005 16 a 11 16 11 Total 16 11 2 3 18 14 Argentina U23 420 421 2008 5 b 2 5 2 Total 5 2 0 0 5 2 Argentina 425 426 2005 3 c 0 2 0 5 0 2006 3 d 1 4 1 7 2 2007 10 e 4 4 2 14 6 2008 6 f 1 2 1 8 2 2009 8 f 1 2 2 10 3 2010 5 g 0 5 2 10 2 2011 8 h 2 5 2 13 4 2012 5 i 5 4 7 9 12 2013 5 i 3 2 3 7 6 2014 7 j 4 7 4 14 8 2015 6 k 1 2 3 8 4 2016 10 l 8 1 0 11 8 2017 5 m 4 2 0 7 4 2018 4 n 1 1 3 5 4 2019 6 o 1 4 4 10 5 2020 4 p 1 0 0 4 1 2021 16 q 9 0 0 16 9 2022 10 r 8 4 10 14 18 2023 5 s 3 3 5 8 8 2024 6 t 1 2 2 8 3 Total 132 58 56 51 188 109 Career total 153 71 58 54 211 125 Nine appearances and five goals in the 2005 South American U-20 Championship seven appearances and six goals in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship .
