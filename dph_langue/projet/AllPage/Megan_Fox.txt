At age 10 after moving to St. Petersburg Florida Fox continued her training. 19 20 When she was 13 years old Fox began modeling after winning several awards at the 1999 American Modeling and Talent Convention in Hilton Head South Carolina . 21 Fox attended high school at Morningside Academy in Port St. Lucie 22 until her junior year when she attended St. Lucie West Centennial High School . 23 When she was 17 she tested out of school via correspondence in order to move to Los Angeles California . 9 15 Fox spoke freely about her time in school stating that in middle school she was bullied and had to eat lunch in the bathroom to avoid being pelted with ketchup packets. She said that the problem was not her looks but that she had always gotten along better with boys and that rubbed some people the wrong way. 24 Fox also said that she was never popular in high school and that everyone hated me and I was a total outcast my friends were always guys I have a very aggressive personality and girls didnt like me for that. Ive had only one great girlfriend my whole life. In the same interview she mentions that she hated school and has never been a big believer in formal education and that the education I was getting seemed irrelevant. So I was sort of checked out on that part of it. 24 Career 2000s: Early roles and breakthrough In 2001 Fox made her acting debut in the romantic comedy Holiday in the Sun as spoiled heiress Brianna Wallace and rival of Alex Stewart Ashley Olsen which was released direct-to-DVD on November 20 2001.

There was controversy surrounding Foxs appearance while filming the sequel when Michael Bay the films director ordered the actress to gain ten pounds. 27 The film was released worldwide on June 24 2009 to box office success. 28 Fox was to star in the third installment Transformers: Dark of the Moon but was not included because of her statements comparing working under director Bay to working for Hitler . She confessed on GQ Magazine that she had lost approximately 30 pounds during filming due to consuming a primary diet of water and vinegar citation needed and reportedly had a dispute over her visible loss of weight with the director on set. 29 30 Bay stated in June 2009 that Fox was fired on orders of executive producer Steven Spielberg 31 a claim Spielberg denied. 32 Fox at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival screening of Jennifers Body on September 10 2009 In 2009 Fox had her first lead role since the Transformers series; she portrayed the title character in Jennifers Body written by Academy Award winning screenwriter Diablo Cody . 33 The film initially earned mixed to average reviews upon its release with Foxs performance earning praise. 34 However the film grew a cult following over time and was critically reassessed as a forgotten feminist classic . 35 According to Cody the film was marketed incorrectly by executives who focused their efforts on the young male audience. 36 In April 2009 she began filming the western superhero film Jonah Hex in which she portrayed Tallulah Black Leila a gun-wielding beauty and Jonah Hexs Josh Brolin love interest. The film was released on June 18 2010. 37 Despite receiving top billing Fox described her role in the film as being a cameo . 38 Jonah Hex was a critical and commercial failure in the U.S. with its international distribution cancelled after its poor performance. 39 The film was named the worst picture of the year by the Houston Film Critics Society . 40 2010s: Rise to prominence Fox starred alongside Mickey Rourke in the drama Passion Play . After premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival its conventional theatrical distribution was bypassed for a direct-to-video release with only two screens briefly showing the film to fulfill contractual obligations. 41 Rourke remarked that the film was terrible. Another terrible movie. 42 43 Fox appeared with Dominic Monaghan in the music video for Eminem and Rihanna s single Love the Way You Lie . 44 In 2012 Fox appeared briefly in Sacha Baron Cohen s comedy film The Dictator and had a featured role in Judd Apatow s comedy film This Is 40 .

In November 2023 Fox released her first book titled Pretty Boys Are Poisonous 68 a collection of her own poetry . Public image Status and persona Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times called Fox a sex symbol of the highest order and said she was the first bona fide sex symbol of the 21st century. 2 Craig Flaster of MTV stated Transformers broke Fox into the mainstream immediately turning her into a household name and international sex symbol. 69 She has been featured on various magazine covers and hottest and most beautiful woman lists throughout the years such as Maxim s Hot 100 lists and when FHM readers voted her the Sexiest Woman in the World in 2008. 2 3 70 People named her one of 2012s and 2017s Most Beautiful at Every Age. 71 72 Scholar Marc DiPaolo stated that Fox achieved instant fame as Mikaela in Transformers because a highly sexualized erotically idealized figure draped over a car or motorcycle invariably evokes lust in the heterosexual male onlooker and Fox did this by leaning over a Camaro while wearing a flimsy pink belly shirt and short skirt which read as an unequivocal sex invite to male viewers. 73 The editors of Mens Health also credited the Camaro scene with contributing to Foxs fame. 74 Fox with two of her tattoos visible Fox at Spike TV s 2007 Scream Awards on October 19 2007 Fox at the 7th Annual Hollywood Life Magazine Breakthrough Awards on December 9 2007 Fox said all women in Hollywood are known and marketed as sex symbols but that this is okay if the woman knows how to utilize the status. 75 76 She created a character for her public image because she was unwilling to sacrifice her true self to the world. 75 77 Scholars Wheeler Winston Dixon and Gwendolyn Audrey Foster disagreed that every woman in Hollywood is marketed as a sex symbol and stated that Foxs celebrity is based on what she admits is an entirely artificial construct designed for dissemination in the Internet age a 21st-century media personality in every sense of the word. 75 Part of her persona included making outlandish comments 77 78 which she said helped her reach her level of fame versus being a typical starlet who said all the right things . 77 Her tattoos which she began getting at age 19 as a form of self-expression 79 helped popularize tattoo fashion. 80 She had over nine known tattoos including a picture of Marilyn Monroe s face on her right forearm and a quote on her shoulder. 81 Author John Tehranian argued that Foxs Monroe tattoo enhanced her implicit claims to Monroes legacy as Hollywoods leading sex symbol. 82 Fox ended up removing the Monroe tattoo in a series of laser surgeries 83 because she felt that Monroes life was full of negativity and she did not want to emulate it. 84 The media often compared Fox to actress Angelina Jolie 2 dubbing her the next Angelina Jolie which also affected her image. 77 Amid this and reports that she was to replace Jolie in a new Lara Croft film 85 Fox commented that the comparisons indicate a lack of creativity on the part of the media 76 and attributed them to both she and Jolie being brunette having tattoos cursing and mentioning and joking about sex 86 87 which people find outrageous . 87 Lynn Hirschberg of The New York Times opined that the Jolie comparison would probably have been made by the media eventually but Fox sped up the process by linking herself to Jolie and that she enjoyed creating entertaining copy by telling tales of darkness and lust. 77 In 2009 Foxs public image came under scrutiny when an unsigned letter from three crew members of Transformers defended director Michael Bay against accusations made by Fox about his on-set behavior including a comparison with Adolf Hitler . 31 88 In response to the letter alleging that Foxs on-set behavior is unpleasant and contrasts her public persona Bay stated he does not condone the letter or Foxs outlandish quotes but her crazy quips are part of her crazy charm and that they still work well together. 31 A production assistant who worked on Transformers also stated that he never saw Fox act inappropriately on set. 88 Fox said the letters claims were false 77 and that she had privately spoken with the parties involved. She said she was very fortunate to be a part of the franchise and was looking forward to continuing her work. 88 DiPaolo concluded that Foxs criticism of the media sexually objectifying girls and women was in stark contrast to her sex symbol status and that her defiance of director Michael Bay and frequent outspoken comments stifled her career. 73 Media exposure Fox at the premiere of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen in Paris on June 12 2009 The increased media exposure was difficult for Fox who acknowledged being shy and insecure to adjust to. 78 89 It also positioned her as a potential role model and later led to her being typecast . She rejected being a formal role model but said that she could make young girls feel strong and intelligent and be outspoken and fight for what they think is right 90 and that she was a different role model for girls that maybe America was not comfortable with. 91 She considered being typecast as attractive an opportunity to surprise people when she gives a good performance in a film 90 76 but said she is interested in portraying less sexualized characters. 89 MTVs Craig Flaster said that although Fox has been typecast as the big-budget sex symbol she has shown comedic range. 69 Foxs overexposure in the media led several mens websites such as AskMen to boycott her on August 4 2009 92 although some refused to do so feeling that the boycott was a publicity stunt and therefore hypocritical. 93 94 In response to the media attention Fox told magazine Nylon in September of that year that the studio wanted to make sure the film would make 700 million so they oversaturated the media with their stars and that she did not want to have people get completely sick of her before shes ever even done something legitimate. 95 She became much less prominent in the media by 2010 after starring in the less commercially successful films Jonah Hex and Passion Play . 96 That same year Fox said My biggest regret is that Ive assisted the media in making me into a cartoon character. I dont regret what has happened to me but I regret the way I have dealt with it. 97 Dixon and Foster stated The problem Fox faces is that the image construct has replaced the real in the minds of the public; and once established a media persona is hard to recalibrate. 75 Personal life In 2009 Fox was targeted by a group of fashion-motivated criminals known as the Bling Ring who robbed her then-boyfriend Brian Austin Green s home for access to Foxs possessions. 98 In 2013 she said that her Christian faith is still very important to her and she believes it keeps her grounded. 99 Fox and then-husband Green were supporters of Generosity Water and funded the creation of over ten water wells for the organization. 100 101 With regard to relationships and her sexuality Fox said that she has a general distrust and dislike of men 102 and that the perception of her as a wild and crazy sexpot is false because she is asocial ; Fox stated that she would rather stay at home instead of going out 103 104 and emphasized that she cannot have sex with someone she does not love. 97 103 She is bisexual and said she believes that all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes . 105 She stated in 2009 I have no question in my mind about being bisexual. But Im also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who was bisexual because that means they also sleep with men and men are so dirty that Id never want to sleep with a girl who had slept with a man. 106 Fox told InStyle in July 2021: A girl would come up to me and be like: You had a lot to do with me like identifying and understanding that I was gay or understanding that I was bisexual... And that of course is by far like the most moving rewarding thing that I have experienced in my life! To be a part of something that helped people figure that out or helped people deal with that or feel better about that. One of my favorite things that I get called is being like a bi icon and that is one of the things I am the most proud of! 107 She has several tattoos which includes the Chinese symbol for strength that is drawn on the back of her neck a quote from the William Shakespeare play King Lear that reads We will all laugh at gilded butterflies the yin and yang symbol on her left wrist and a crescent moon entwined with a star on her ankle. Fox also has a poem tattooed near her breast that reads There once was a little girl who never knew love until a boy broke her heart and another tattoo on her back that quotes Friedrich Nietzsche : And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music. She claims that she had it drawn in honor of her Passion Play costar Mickey Rourke but later clarified that its not necessarily a homage to him. 108 She also once had her ex-husband Brian Austin Green s first name tattooed on her hip but later had it covered. She removed the portrait of Marilyn Monroe that was tattooed on her right forearm stating It is a negative character as she suffered from personality disorders and was bipolar. I do not want to attract this kind of negative energy in my life. 109 110 She also has a tattoo on her left collarbone that reads the gunman in Spanish as well as numerous flowers and one snake on her abdomen. Fox has numerous smaller tattoos splayed across her fingers some of which include dots numbers and a crescent moon. 111 Health Fox has a form of brachydactyly called brachydactyly type D 112 and has discussed her obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD insecurities self-harming and has acknowledged that she has low self-esteem . 113 Fox revealed in her book Pretty Boys Are Poisonous that she has suffered a miscarriage from her pregnancy with what would have been her fourth child. 114 Relationships Fox and Brian Austin Green at the 70th Golden Globes on January 13 2013 Machine Gun Kelly and Fox at the 2022 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game on February 18 2022 Fox began dating actor Brian Austin Green in 2004 after meeting on the set of Hope Faith ; she was 18 years old while he was 30. 115 116 According to Fox Green was initially hesitant to enter a relationship with her due to the age difference stating I had to convince him that I was slightly more responsible and well-spoken and had other things to bring to the table besides being 18. She disclosed that she has fallen in love with other people all the time throughout their relationship since she was 18. 117 118 Fox and Green became engaged in November 2006. 119 In February 2009 they ended their engagement 119 but were reported to have become re-engaged on June 1 2010. 120 Fox maintained that she and Green had been continuously engaged since 2006. 121 Fox and Green married on June 24 2010 in a private ceremony at the Four Seasons Resort on Maui . 122 123 Together they have three sons born in 2012 124 2014 125 and 2016. 126 Fox also became a stepmother to Greens son from a previous relationship. 127 Fox filed for divorce on August 21 2015 a few days after she and Green announced their separation. 128 129 By early 2016 they were back together and expecting their third child. 130 On April 25 2019 Fox filed to dismiss her second attempt for a divorce in Los Angeles California. 131 In May 2020 Green announced that he and Fox had separated after nearly 10 years of marriage 132 133 and in November 2020 Fox filed for divorce from Green for a second time. 134 The divorce was finalized on October 15 2021. 135 In June 2020 she and singer Machine Gun Kelly went public about their relationship several weeks after the release of Machine Gun Kellys song Bloody Valentine whose music video features Fox. 136 On January 12 2022 Fox announced that the two were engaged. 137 However on March 21 2024 she announced their engagement was called off. 138 139 Filmography Film Year Title Role Notes 2001 Holiday in the Sun Brianna Wallace Direct-to-video 2003 Bad Boys II Bikini Kid Dancing Under Waterfall Uncredited extra 140 2004 Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen Carla Santini 2007 Transformers Mikaela Banes 2008 How to Lose Friends Alienate People Sophie Maes Whore Lost 2009 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Mikaela Banes Jennifers Body Jennifer Check 2010 Jonah Hex Tallulah Black Lilah Passion Play Lily Luster 2011 Friends with Kids Mary Jane 2012 The Dictator Herself This Is 40 Desi 2014 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 141 April ONeil 2016 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows 2019 Above the Shadows Juliana Zeroville Soledad Paladin The Battle of Jangsari Maggie 2020 Think Like a Dog Ellen Reed Rogue Samantha OHara 2021 Till Death Emma Midnight in the Switchgrass Rebecca Lombardi Night Teeth Grace 142 2022 Big Gold Brick Jacqueline Taurus Mae 143 Good Mourning Kennedy 144 2023 Johnny Clyde Alana Hart 145 Expend4bles Gina 146 2024 Subservience Alice Television Year Title Role Notes 20022003 Ocean Ave. Ione Starr Main role 2003 What I Like About You Shannon Episode: Like a Virgin Kinda 2004 Two and a Half Men Prudence Episode: Camel Filters and Pheromones The Help Cassandra Ridgeway 3 episodes Boss Girl Candace Television film 20042006 Hope Faith Sydney Shanowski 48 episodes Season 23 2009 Saturday Night Live Herself Host Episode: Megan Fox U2 2011 Robot Chicken Herself Lois Lane voice Episode: The Core the Thief His Wife and Her Lover 2012 Robot Chicken DC Comics Special Lois Lane voice Television film Wedding Band Alexa Jordan Episode: I Love College 20162017 New Girl Reagan Lucas 15 episodes Season 56 2018 Legends of the Lost with Megan Fox Herself Host 4 episodes; also co-creator and executive producer 2023 Dave Herself Episode: Met Gala Video games Year Title Role Notes 2007 Transformers: The Game Mikaela Banes 2009 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen 2023 Mortal Kombat 1 Nitara Voice and Facial model Music videos Year Title Artist Role Notes 2009 New Perspective Panic! at the Disco Jennifer Check Clips from Jennifers Body 2010 Love the Way You Lie Eminem featuring Rihanna Kimberly Scott 2020 Bloody Valentine Machine Gun Kelly Herself 147 2024 Lonely Road Machine Gun Kelly and Jelly Roll Herself Awards and nominations Main article: List of awards and nominations received by Megan Fox Fox has received numerous awards and nominations including four Teen Choice Awards and two Scream Awards .
