That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in L.A. 12 Kunis has cited antisemitism in the Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her familys move to the United States. 13 14 15 16 17 She has stated that her parents raised her Jewish as much as they could although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union . 18 13 On her second day in Los Angeles Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didnt understand the culture. I didnt understand the people. I didnt understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven. And thats kind of what it felt like moving to the States. 19 In Los Angeles she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School . She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming That 70s Show . 20 She briefly attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies LACES but when that school proved to be insufficiently flexible about her acting commitments she transferred to Fairfax High School 21 graduating in 2001. 16 She briefly attended University of California Los Angeles UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. 7 22 Kunis has said that a genealogical DNA test described her ethnicity as 96 23 24 to 98 Ashkenazi Jewish . 25 Career 19942000: Career beginnings and television work At age nine Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios where she met Susan Curtis who would become her manager. 26 27 On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial. 28 Shortly after she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line. 29 Her first television roles took place in 1994 first appearing on Days of Our Lives 30 31 and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on Baywatch . 32 She had a minor role on the television shows 7th Heaven 20 and Walker Texas Ranger as well as supporting roles in the films Santa with Muscles Honey We Shrunk Ourselves and the Angelina Jolie film Gia as the young Gia Carangi . 7 At the age of 10 Kunis unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to North America in the film Make a Wish Molly . 9 Instead she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl. 21 In 1998 Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That 70s Show . All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis who was 14 at the time told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. 27 That 70s Show ran for eight seasons. 33 She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances. 34 In 1999 Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy 35 created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character in part due to her performance on That 70s Show . When Kunis auditioned for the role she was called back by MacFarlane who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways I thought almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job but there was something about Mila something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation theyll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work. 36 Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in Family Guy Video Game! released in 2006. Kunis described her character as the scapegoat. 37 20012008: Transition to film In 2001 she appeared in Get Over It opposite Kirsten Dunst . She followed that up in 2002 by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho .

Although the film was shot in 2004 it did not have a theatrical release until 2007. 40 Most critics did not like the film which mustered a 25 approval from Rotten Tomatoes. 41 DVD talk concluded that fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place . 42 Kunis at the premiere of Max Payne in 2008 In 2005 Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in Moving McAllister which was not released theatrically until 2007. 43 The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters. 44 45 She followed up with After Sex starring alongside Zoe Saldana who had also appeared in Get Over It . 46 In October 2006 she began filming Boot Camp originally titled Straight Edge . 47 The film was not released in theaters in the United States but was released on DVD on August 25 2009. 48 Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film Forgetting Sarah Marshall co-produced by Judd Apatow . The role which she won after unsuccessfully auditioning for Knocked Up 2 entailed improvisation on her part. 49 The film garnered positive reviews 50 and was a commercial success grossing 105 million worldwide. 51 Kuniss performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised her fresh beauty and focused energy 52 while James Berardinelli wrote that she is adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing . 53 She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award . 54 In an interview Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from That 70s Show . 2 Also in 2008 Kunis portrayed Mona Sax an assassin alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film Max Payne based on the video game of the same name . Kunis underwent training in guns boxing and martial arts for her role. 55 Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office grossing 85 million worldwide 56 but was poorly reviewed by critics 57 with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast. 58 59 Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was horribly miscast as some sort of undersized warble-voiced crime boss . 60 Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying Mila just bowled us over..... She wasnt an obvious choice but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park. 55 She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film. 61 20092012: Film breakthrough and acclaim Kunis promoting Family Guy in 2009 In 2009 she appeared in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman . The film received mostly positive reviews 62 and grossed 10.8 million at the box office. 63 Roger Ebert while critical of the film itself wrote that Kunis brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility. 64 Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected . Judge said: As beautiful as Mila is you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world. 65 After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract : I just thought Wow this girls perfect. And she really wanted to do it which was fantastic. Kunis herself stated that Im a huge fan of Mike Judges from Office Space so I was like Okay this is a very easy decision. I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production like craft service or say acting. 66 In 2010 she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film The Book of Eli . Although the film received mixed reviews 67 it performed well at the box office grossing over 157 million worldwide. 68 Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kuniss performance calling it a particularly strong piece of work . 69 Several other reviews were equally positive including that of Pete Hammond of Boxoffice magazine who wrote that shes ideally cast in the key female role . 70 Even reviewers who did not necessarily like the film complimented her performance such as James Berardinelli who wrote that the demands of the role prove to be within her range which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts 71 and Colin Covert of the Star Tribune who wrote that she generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character developing an independent female character whos not always in need of rescuing. 72 Other critics such as Claudia Puig of USA Today felt she was miscast noting that she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial . 73 Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance. 74 75 Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film Date Night starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell . 76 She garnered several positive reviews for her performance. 77 78 79 Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it a shot in the arm. 80 Kunis at San Diego Comic-Con in 2012 Kunis was nominated for multiple awards including her first Golden Globe for the 2010 film Black Swan .
