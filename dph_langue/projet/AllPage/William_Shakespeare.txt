He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the worlds pre-eminent dramatist. 4 5 6 He is often called Englands national poet and the Bard of Avon or simply the Bard . His extant works including collaborations consist of some 39 plays 154 sonnets three long narrative poems and a few other verses some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. 7 Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon Warwickshire. At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor writer and part-owner sharer of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlains Men later known as the Kings Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 around 1613 he appears to have retired to Stratford where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeares private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance his sexuality his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories 8 as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others . 9 10 11 Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. 12 13 His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608 among them Hamlet Othello King Lear and Macbeth all considered to be among the finest works in English. 4 5 6 In the last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies also known as romances such as The Winters Tale and The Tempest and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of Shakespeares plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However in 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeares published a more definitive text known as the First Folio a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeares dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson a former rival of Shakespeare who hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: not of an age but for all time . 14 Life Main article: Life of William Shakespeare Early life John Shakespeare s house believed to be Shakespeares birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare an alderman and a successful glover glove-maker originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire and Mary Arden the daughter of an affluent landowning family . 15 He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown but is traditionally observed on 23 April Saint Georges Day . 2 This date which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. 16 17 He was the third of eight children and the eldest surviving son. 18 Although no attendance records for the period survive most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the Kings New School in Stratford 19 20 21 a free school chartered in 1553 22 about a quarter-mile 400 m from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree 23 24 and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors. 25 At the age of 18 Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway . The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day two of Hathaways neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. 26 The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times 27 28 and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter Susanna baptised 26 May 1583. 29 Twins son Hamnet and daughter Judith followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. 30 Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596. 31 Shakespeares coat of arms from the 1602 book The book of coates and creasts. Promptuarium armorum. It features spears as a pun on the family name. c After the birth of the twins Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the complaints bill of a law case before the Queens Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589. 32 Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeares lost years . 33 Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe Shakespeares first biographer recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy . Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him. 34 35 Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London. 36 John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster. 37 Some 20th-century scholars suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire a Catholic landowner who named a certain William Shakeshafte in his will. 38 39 Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area. 40 41 London and theatrical career It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. 42 By then he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit from that year: ... there is an upstart Crow beautified with our feathers that with his Tigers heart wrapped in a Players hide supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country. 43 Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greenes words 43 44 but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe Thomas Nashe and Greene himself the so-called University Wits . 45 The italicised phrase parodying the line Oh tigers heart wrapped in a womans hide from Shakespeares Henry VI Part 3 along with the pun Shake-scene clearly identify Shakespeare as Greenes target. As used here Johannes Factotum Jack of all trades refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others rather than the more common universal genius . 43 46 Greenes attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeares work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greenes remarks. 47 48 49 After 1594 Shakespeares plays were performed at The Theatre in Shoreditch only by the Lord Chamberlains Men a company owned by a group of players including Shakespeare that soon became the leading playing company in London. 50 After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603 the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I and changed its name to the Kings Men . 51 All the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts ... As You Like It Act II Scene 7 139142 52 In 1599 a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames which they named the Globe . In 1608 the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre . Extant records of Shakespeares property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man 53 and in 1597 he bought the second-largest house in Stratford New Place and in 1605 invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford. 54 Some of Shakespeares plays were published in quarto editions beginning in 1594 and by 1598 his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages . 55 56 57 Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson s Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour 1598 and Sejanus His Fall 1603. 58 The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonsons Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. 47 The First Folio of 1623 however lists Shakespeare as one of the Principal Actors in all these Plays some of which were first staged after Volpone although one cannot know for certain which roles he played. 59 In 1610 John Davies of Hereford wrote that good Will played kingly roles. 60 In 1709 Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlets father. 61 Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It and the Chorus in Henry V 62 63 though scholars doubt the sources of that information. 64 Throughout his career Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596 the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helens Bishopsgate north of the River Thames. 65 66 He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599 the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there. 65 67 By 1604 he had moved north of the river again to an area north of St Pauls Cathedral with many fine houses. There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy a maker of womens wigs and other headgear. 68 69 Later years and death Shakespeares funerary monument in Stratford-upon-Avon Nicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition repeated by Samuel Johnson that Shakespeare retired to Stratford some years before his death . 70 71 He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans the Kings Men placed men players there which were Heminges Condell Shakespeare etc. . 72 However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609. 73 74 The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610 75 which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time. 76 Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 16111614. 70 In 1612 he was called as a witness in Bellott v Mountjoy a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoys daughter Mary. 77 78 In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory; 79 and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law John Hall . 80 After 1610 Shakespeare wrote fewer plays and none are attributed to him after 1613. 81 His last three plays were collaborations probably with John Fletcher 82 who succeeded him as the house playwright of the Kings Men. He retired in 1613 before the Globe Theatre burned down during the performance of Henry VIII on 29 June. 81 Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52. d He died within a month of signing his will a document which he begins by describing himself as being in perfect health . No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later John Ward the vicar of Stratford wrote in his notebook: Shakespeare Drayton and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and it seems drank too hard for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted 84 85 not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton . Of the tributes from fellow authors one refers to his relatively sudden death: We wondered Shakespeare that thou wentst so soon From the worlds stage to the graves tiring room. 86 e Holy Trinity Church Stratford-upon-Avon where Shakespeare was baptised and is buried He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician John Hall in 1607 87 and Judith had married Thomas Quiney a vintner two months before Shakespeares death. 88 Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day Thomas Quiney his new son-in-law was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler both of whom had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family. 88 Shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna 89 under stipulations that she pass it down intact to the first son of her body . 90 The Quineys had three children all of whom died without marrying. 91 92 The Halls had one child Elizabeth who married twice but died without children in 1670 ending Shakespeares direct line. 93 94 Shakespeares will scarcely mentions his wife Anne who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically. f He did make a point however of leaving her my second best bed a bequest that has led to much speculation. 96 97 98 Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance. 99 Shakespeares grave next to those of Anne Shakespeare his wife and Thomas Nash the husband of his granddaughter Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death. 100 101 The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008: 102 Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare To digg the dvst encloased heare. Bleste be y man y spares thes stones And cvrst be he y moves my bones. 103 g Good friend for Jesus sake forbear To dig the dust enclosed here. Blessed be the man that spares these stones And cursed be he that moves my bones. Some time before 1623 a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor Socrates and Virgil . 104 In 1623 in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio the Droeshout engraving was published. 105 Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey . 106 107 Plays Main articles: Shakespeares plays William Shakespeares collaborations and Shakespeare bibliography Procession of Characters from Shakespeares Plays by an unknown 19th-century artist Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point as critics agree Shakespeare did mostly early and late in his career. 108 The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama . Shakespeares plays are difficult to date precisely however 109 110 and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus The Comedy of Errors The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeares earliest period. 111 109 His first histories which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinsheds Chronicles of England Scotland and Ireland 112 dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty . 113 The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe by the traditions of medieval drama and by the plays of Seneca . 114 115 116 The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found though it has an identical plot but different wording as another play with a similar name. 117 118 Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona in which two friends appear to approve of rape 119 120 121 the Shrew s story of the taming of a womans independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics directors and audiences. 122 Oberon Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing . By William Blake c. 1786. Shakespeares early classical and Italianate comedies containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies. 123 A Midsummer Nights Dream is a witty mixture of romance fairy magic and comic lowlife scenes. 124 Shakespeares next comedy the equally romantic The Merchant of Venice contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock which reflects dominant Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences. 125 126 The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing 127 the charming rural setting of As You Like It and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeares sequence of great comedies. 128 After the lyrical Richard II written almost entirely in verse Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s Henry IV Part 1 and 2 and Henry V . Henry IV features Falstaff rogue wit and friend of Prince Hal. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes prose and poetry and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work. 129 130 131 This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence love and death; 132 133 and Julius Caesar based on Sir Thomas North s 1579 translation of Plutarch s Parallel Lives which introduced a new kind of drama. 134 135 According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro in Julius Caesar the various strands of politics character inwardness contemporary events even Shakespeares own reflections on the act of writing began to infuse each other . 136 Hamlet Horatio Marcellus and the Ghost of Hamlets Father . Henry Fuseli 17801785. In the early 17th century Shakespeare wrote the so-called problem plays Measure for Measure Troilus and Cressida and Alls Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies . 137 138 Many critics believe that Shakespeares tragedies represent the peak of his art. Hamlet has probably been analysed more than any other Shakespearean character especially for his famous soliloquy which begins To be or not to be; that is the question . 139 Unlike the introverted Hamlet whose fatal flaw is hesitation Othello and Lear are undone by hasty errors of judgement. 140 The plots of Shakespeares tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. 141 In Othello Iago stokes Othellos sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him. 142 143 In King Lear the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lears youngest daughter Cordelia . According to the critic Frank Kermode the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty . 144 145 146 In Macbeth the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeares tragedies 147 uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn. 148 In this play Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus contain some of Shakespeares finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot . 149 150 151 Eliot wrote Shakespeare acquired more essential history from Plutarch than most men could from the whole British Museum . 152 In his final period Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline The Winters Tale and The Tempest as well as the collaboration Pericles Prince of Tyre . Less bleak than the tragedies these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. 153 Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeares part but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. 154 155 156 Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen probably with John Fletcher . 157 Classification Further information: Chronology of Shakespeares plays The Plays of William Shakespeare a painting containing scenes and characters from several plays of Shakespeare; by Sir John Gilbert c. 1849 Shakespeares works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623 listed according to their folio classification as comedies histories and tragedies . 158 Two plays not included in the First Folio 14 The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles Prince of Tyre are now accepted as part of the canon with todays scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both. 159 160 No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio. In the late 19th century Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies Dowdens term is often used. 161 162 In 1896 Frederick S. Boas coined the term problem plays to describe four plays: Alls Well That Ends Well Measure for Measure Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet . 163 Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies he wrote. We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeares problem plays. 164 The term much debated and sometimes applied to other plays remains in use though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy. 165 166 167 Performances Main article: Shakespeare in performance It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes. 168 After the plagues of 159293 Shakespeares plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch north of the Thames. 169 Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV Leonard Digges recording Let but Falstaff come Hal Poins the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room . 170 When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre the first playhouse built by actors for actors on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark . 171 172 The Globe opened in autumn 1599 with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeares greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe including Hamlet Othello and King Lear . 171 173 174 The reconstructed Globe Theatre on the south bank of the River Thames in London After the Lord Chamberlains Men were renamed the Kings Men in 1603 they entered a special relationship with the new King James . Although the performance records are patchy the Kings Men performed seven of Shakespeares plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605 including two performances of The Merchant of Venice . 63 After 1608 they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer. 175 The indoor setting combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In Cymbeline for example Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees. 176 177 The actors in Shakespeares company included the famous Richard Burbage William Kempe Henry Condell and John Heminges . Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeares plays including Richard III Hamlet Othello and King Lear . 178 The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing among other characters. 179 180 He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear . 181 In 1613 Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony . 182 On 29 June however a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision. 182 Textual sources Title page of the First Folio 1623. Copper engraving of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout . In 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell two of Shakespeares friends from the Kings Men published the First Folio a collected edition of Shakespeares plays. It contained 36 texts including 18 printed for the first time. 183 The others had already appeared in quarto versionsflimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves. 184 No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions which the First Folio describes as stoln and surreptitious copies . 185 Alfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as bad quartos because of their adapted paraphrased or garbled texts which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. 184 185 186 Where several versions of a play survive each differs from the others . The differences may stem from copying or printing errors from notes by actors or audience members or from Shakespeares own papers . 187 188 In some cases for example Hamlet Troilus and Cressida and Othello Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear however while most modern editions do conflate them the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion. 189 Poems In 1593 and 1594 when the theatres were closed because of plague Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece . He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley Earl of Southampton . In Venus and Adonis an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus ; while in The Rape of Lucrece the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin . 190 Influenced by Ovid s Metamorphoses 191 the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust. 192 Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeares lifetime. A third narrative poem A Lovers Complaint in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lovers Complaint . Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. 193 194 195 The Phoenix and the Turtle printed in Robert Chesters 1601 Loves Martyr mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover the faithful turtle dove . In 1599 two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim published under Shakespeares name but without his permission. 193 195 196 Sonnets Main article: Shakespeares sonnets Title page from 1609 edition of Shake-Speares Sonnets Published in 1609 the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeares non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership. 197 198 Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599 Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeares sugred Sonnets among his private friends . 199 Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeares intended sequence. 200 He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion the dark lady and one about conflicted love for a fair young man the fair youth . It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals or if the authorial I who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets Shakespeare unlocked his heart . 199 198 Shall I compare thee to a summers day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate ... Opening lines from Shakespeares Sonnet 18 . 201 The 1609 edition was dedicated to a Mr. W.H. credited as the only begetter of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher Thomas Thorpe whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was despite numerous theories or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication. 202 Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love sexual passion procreation death and time. 203 Style Main article: Shakespeares writing style Shakespeares first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama. 204 The poetry depends on extended sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits and the language is often rhetoricalwritten for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus in the view of some critics often hold up the action for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted. 205 206 Pity by William Blake 1795 is an illustration of two similes in Macbeth : And pity like a naked new-born babe Striding the blast or heavens cherubim horsd Upon the sightless couriers of the air. 207 However Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time Richards vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeares mature plays. 208 209 No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. 210 By the time of Romeo and Juliet Richard II and A Midsummer Nights Dream in the mid-1590s Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself. Shakespeares standard poetic form was blank verse composed in iambic pentameter . In practice this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful but its sentences tend to start pause and finish at the end of lines with the risk of monotony. 211 Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet . Shakespeare uses it for example to convey the turmoil in Hamlets mind: 212 Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly And praisd be rashness for itlet us know Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well ... Hamlet Act 5 Scene 2 48 212 After Hamlet Shakespeare varied his poetic style further particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as more concentrated rapid varied and in construction less regular not seldom twisted or elliptical . 213 In the last phase of his career Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines irregular pauses and stops and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. 214 In Macbeth for example the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself? 1.7.3538; ... pity like a naked new-born babe Striding the blast or heavens cherubim horsd Upon the sightless couriers of the air ... 1.7.2125. The listener is challenged to complete the sense. 214 The late romances with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another clauses are piled up subject and object are reversed and words are omitted creating an effect of spontaneity. 215 Shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre. 216 Like all playwrights of the time he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed . 217 He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. 218 As Shakespeares mastery grew he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays however. In Shakespeares late romances he deliberately returned to a more artificial style which emphasised the illusion of theatre. 219 220 Legacy Influence Main article: Shakespeares influence Macbeth Consulting the Vision of the Armed Head . By Henry Fuseli 17931794. Shakespeares work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation plot language and genre. 221 Until Romeo and Juliet for example romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. 222 Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events but Shakespeare used them to explore characters minds. 223 His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as feeble variations on Shakespearean themes. 224 John Milton considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare wrote in tribute: Thou in our wonder and astonishment Hast built thyself a live-long monument. 225 Shakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy William Faulkner and Charles Dickens . The American novelist Herman Melville s soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is a classic tragic hero inspired by King Lear . 226 Scholars have identified 20 000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeares works including Felix Mendelssohn s overture and incidental music for A Midsummer Nights Dream and Sergei Prokofiev s ballet Romeo and Juliet . His work has inspired several operas among them Giuseppe Verdi s Macbeth Otello and Falstaff whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays. 227 Shakespeare has also inspired many painters including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites while William Hogarth s 1745 painting of actor David Garrick playing Richard III was decisive in establishing the genre of theatrical portraiture in Britain. 228 The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli a friend of William Blake even translated Macbeth into German. 229 The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology in particular that of Hamlet for his theories of human nature. 230 Shakespeare has been a rich source for filmmakers; Akira Kurosawa adapted Macbeth and King Lear as Throne of Blood and Ran respectively. Other examples of Shakespeare on film include Max Reinhardt s A Midsummer Nights Dream Laurence Olivier s Hamlet and Al Pacino s documentary Looking For Richard . 231 Orson Welles a lifelong lover of Shakespeare directed and starred in Macbeth Othello and Chimes at Midnight in which he plays John Falstaff which Welles himself called his best work. 232 In Shakespeares day English grammar spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now 233 and his use of language helped shape modern English. 234 Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language the first serious work of its type. 235 Expressions such as with bated breath Merchant of Venice and a foregone conclusion Othello have found their way into everyday English speech. 236 237 Shakespeares influence extends far beyond his native England and the English language. His reception in Germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century Shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in Germany and gradually became a classic of the German Weimar era ; Christoph Martin Wieland was the first to produce complete translations of Shakespeares plays in any language. 238 239 Actor and theatre director Simon Callow writes this master this titan this genius so profoundly British and so effortlessly universal each different culture German Italian Russian was obliged to respond to the Shakespearean example; for the most part they embraced it and him with joyous abandon as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. Some of the most deeply affecting productions of Shakespeare have been non-English and non-European. He is that unique writer: he has something for everyone. 240 According to Guinness World Records Shakespeare remains the worlds best-selling playwright with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. He is also the third most translated author in history . 241 Critical reputation Main articles: Reputation of William Shakespeare and Timeline of Shakespeare criticism He was not of an age but for all time. Ben Jonson 242 Shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime but he received a large amount of praise. 243 244 In 1598 the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English playwrights as the most excellent in both comedy and tragedy. 245 246 The authors of the Parnassus plays at St Johns College Cambridge numbered him with Chaucer Gower and Spenser . 247 In the First Folio Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the Soul of the age the applause delight the wonder of our stage although he had remarked elsewhere that Shakespeare wanted art lacked skill. 242 Between the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century classical ideas were in vogue. As a result critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson. 248 Thomas Rymer for example condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly saying of Jonson I admire him but I love Shakespeare . 249 He also famously remarked that Shakespeare was naturally learned; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards and found her there. 250 For several decades Rymers view held sway. But during the 18th century critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and like Dryden to acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790 added to his growing reputation. 251 252 By 1800 he was firmly enshrined as the national poet 253 and described as the Bard of Avon or simply the Bard . 254 h In the 18th and 19th centuries his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire Goethe Stendhal and Victor Hugo . 256 i William Ordway Partridge s garlanded statue of William Shakespeare in Lincoln Park Chicago typical of many created in the 19th and early 20th centuries During the Romantic era Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism . 258 In the 19th century critical admiration for Shakespeares genius often bordered on adulation. 259 This King Shakespeare the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840 does not he shine in crowned sovereignty over us all as the noblest gentlest yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible . 260 The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale. 261 The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as bardolatry claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen s plays had made Shakespeare obsolete. 262 The modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century far from discarding Shakespeare eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde . The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T. S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeares primitiveness in fact made him truly modern. 263 Eliot along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeares imagery. In the 1950s a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for post-modern studies of Shakespeare. 264 Comparing Shakespeares accomplishments to those of leading figures in philosophy and theology Harold Bloom wrote Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine . He encloses us because we see with his fundamental perceptions. 265 Speculation Authorship Main article: Shakespeare authorship question Around 230 years after Shakespeares death doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him. 266 Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford . 267 Several group theories have also been proposed. 268 All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution 269 but interest in the subject particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship continues into the 21st century. 270 271 272 Religion Main article: Religious views of William Shakespeare Shakespeare conformed to the official state religion j but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. Shakespeares will uses a Protestant formula and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England where he was married his children were baptised and where he is buried. Some scholars are of the view that members of Shakespeares family were Catholics at a time when practising Catholicism in England was against the law. 274 Shakespeares mother Mary Arden certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father John Shakespeare found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity. 275 276 In 1591 the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church for fear of process for debt a common Catholic excuse. 277 278 279 In 1606 the name of Williams daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford. 277 278 279 Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeares religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeares Catholicism Protestantism or lack of belief in his plays but the truth may be impossible to prove. 280 281 Sexuality Main article: Sexuality of William Shakespeare Artistic depiction of the Shakespeare family late 19th century Few details of Shakespeares sexuality are known. At 18 he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway who was pregnant. Susanna the first of their three children was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeares sonnets are autobiographical 282 and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love. 283 284 285 The 26 so-called Dark Lady sonnets addressed to a married woman are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons. 286 Portraiture Main article: Portraits of Shakespeare No written contemporary description of Shakespeares physical appearance survives and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait. From the 18th century the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. 287 That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits as well as misattributions re-paintings and relabelling of portraits of other people. 288 289 Some scholars suggest that the Droeshout portrait which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness 290 and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. 291 Of the claimed paintings art historian Tarnya Cooper concluded that the Chandos portrait shown at the top of this article had the strongest claim of any of the known contenders to be a true portrait of Shakespeare . After a three-year study supported by the National Portrait Gallery London the portraits owners Cooper contended that its composition date contemporary with Shakespeare its subsequent provenance and the sitters attire all supported the attribution. 292 See also Outline of William Shakespeare English Renaissance theatre Spelling of Shakespeares name World Shakespeare Bibliography Shakespeares Politics References Notes The belief that Shakespeare was born on 23 April is a tradition and not a verified fact; 2 see Early life below. He was baptised 26 April. Dates follow the Julian calendar used in England throughout Shakespeares lifespan but with the start of the year adjusted to 1 January see Old Style and New Style dates . Under the Gregorian calendar adopted in Catholic countries in 1582 Shakespeare died on 3 May. 3 The crest is a silver falcon supporting a spear while the motto is Non Sanz Droict French for not without right . This motto is still used by Warwickshire County Council in reference to Shakespeare. Inscribed in Latin on his funerary monument : AETATIS 53 DIE 23 APR In his 53rd year he died 23 April. 83 Verse by James Mabbe printed in the First Folio. 86 Charles Knight 1842 in his notes on Twelfth Night . 95 In the scribal abbreviations ye for the 3rd line and yt for that 3rd and 4th lines the letter y represents th : see thorn . The national cult of Shakespeare and the bard identification dates from September 1769 when the actor David Garrick organised a week-long carnival at Stratford to mark the town council awarding him the freedom of the town. In addition to presenting the town with a statue of Shakespeare Garrick composed a doggerel verse lampooned in the London newspapers naming the banks of the Avon as the birthplace of the matchless Bard . 255 Grady cites Voltaire s Philosophical Letters 1733; Goethes Wilhelm Meisters Apprenticeship 1795; Stendhal s two-part pamphlet Racine et Shakespeare 182325; and Victor Hugo s prefaces to Cromwell 1827 and William Shakespeare 1864. 257 For example A.L. Rowse the 20th-century Shakespeare scholar was emphatic: He died as he had lived a conforming member of the Church of England. His will made that perfectly clearin facts puts it beyond dispute for it uses the Protestant formula. 273 Citations Folger Shakespeare Library . Folger Shakespeare Library .
