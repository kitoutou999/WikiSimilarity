In 2009 James became proficient at the chase-down block which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot. 76 In Miami he developed into a more versatile defensive player and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions. 443 Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme 444 with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position. 445 Beginning in 2014 some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines. 446 447 During his second stint in Cleveland James defense progressively declined.

Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan. 476 Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordans status as the greatest basketball player of all time Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim and that in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse Jordan having more titles and an unblemished Finals record holds significant weight . 472 In addition to praising James on-court accomplishments analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James move to the Heat in 2010 defined a decade of player movement and that he fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations. 477 James fellow players have also remarked on his influence such as Warriors forward Draymond Green who reflected: Weve taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that hes opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment. 478 Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in superteams in the 21st century. 479 480 481 482 483 In 2022 James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce . 484 This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft making them the first father-son duo in NBA history . 485 Personal life James married his high school sweetheart Savannah James on September 14 2013 in San Diego California. 486 They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce and daughter Zhuri. 484 487 Bronny was a standout high school basketball player being named a McDonalds All-American in 2023 20 years after Jamess selection. 488 During his stint with the Heat James resided in Coconut Grove where he bought a 9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay . 489 In November 2015 James bought a 9 350 square-foot 870 m 2 East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood Los Angeles for about 21 million. 490 He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for 23 million. 491 In September 2020 he purchased a third home in Los Angeles this one in Beverly Hills for 36.75 million. 492 James also owns a 30 000 square foot mansion in Akron Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent 2.1 million on it. 493 Jamess best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony Chris Paul and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade.

Our youth deserve better!! 559 James also called President Donald Trump a bum after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry. 560 During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports suggesting that sports has never been something that divides people its always been something that brings someone together. He declared that he would never sit across from him. Id sit across from Obama though. 561 562 In response Trump tweeted: LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart which isnt easy to do. 563 On August 19 2020 James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election . 564 James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote 565 saying People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past thatve been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression. 566 Media figure and business interests According to Forbes in May 2023 James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire. 567 James biography LeBron was published on April 11 2023 by Jeff Benedict . The biography is based on three years of research and more than 250 interviews. 568 Endorsements James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are Audemars Piguet 569 Beats by Dre 570 Coca-Cola 571 Kia 572 Blaze Pizza 573 ATT 574 Intel 575 PepsiCo 576 Taco Bell 577 Dunkin Brands 578 McDonalds 579 Nike 571 and State Farm . 580 Coming out of high school James was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike Reebok and Adidas 581 eventually signing a seven-year deal with Nike in 2003 582 for approximately 90 million. 583 His signature shoes have performed well for Nike. 584 In 2011 Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights and as part of the deal James was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool 585 who he has claimed his support for. 586 As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary James has been listed as one of the worlds highest-paid athletes. 587 In 2013 he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world with earnings of 56.5 million. 588 In 2014 James realized a profit of more than 30 million as part of Apple s acquisition of Beats Electronics ; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones. 589 In 2015 James was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson 590 and third highest in 2016 after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi . 591 James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future albeit in a hands-off capacity. 592 In 2011 James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami Florida. 593 During Super Bowl LVI in 2022 James appeared in a Crypto.com advertisement where he conversed with a CGI version of his younger self offering advice about the future.
