Nicknamed Iron Mike 4 and Kid Dynamite in his early career and later known as the Baddest Man on the Planet 5 Tyson is regarded as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. 6 He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years 4 months and 22 days old Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title . 7 He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA WBC and IBF titles as well as the only heavyweight to unify them in succession. The following year Tyson became the lineal champion when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round. 8 In 1990 Tyson was knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas 9 in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history . In 1992 Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison. He was released on parole after three years. 10 After his release in 1995 he engaged in a series of comeback fights regaining the WBA and WBC titles in 1996 to join Floyd Patterson Muhammad Ali Tim Witherspoon Evander Holyfield and George Foreman as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after losing it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year Tyson lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield by an eleventh round stoppage. Their 1997 rematch ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfields ears one bite notoriously being strong enough to remove a portion of his right ear. In 2002 Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis . Tyson was known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial behavior inside and outside the ring which he explained was inspired by Sonny Liston a boxer who is widely regarded as the most intimidating man in the history of boxing. 11 12 With a knockout-to-win percentage of 88 13 he was ranked 16th on The Ring magazines list of 100 greatest punchers of all time 14 and first on ESPN s list of The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History . 15 Sky Sports described him as perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring . 16 He has been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame . Early life Michael Gerard Tyson was born in Fort Greene Brooklyn New York City on June 30 1966. 17 18 He has an older brother named Rodney born c. 1961 19 and had an older sister named Denise who died of a heart attack at age 24 in February 1990. 20 Tysons mother born in Charlottesville Virginia 21 was described as a promiscuous woman who might have been a prostitute. 22 Tysons biological father is listed as Purcell Tyson a humble cab driver who was from Jamaica on his birth certificate 23 24 but the man Tyson had known as his father was a pimp named Jimmy Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was from Grier Town North Carolina a predominantly black neighborhood that was annexed by the city of Charlotte 25 where he was one of the neighborhoods top baseball players. Kirkpatrick married and had a son Tysons half-brother Jimmie Lee Kirkpatrick who would help to integrate Charlotte high school football in 1965. In 1959 Jimmy Kirkpatrick left his family and moved to Brooklyn where he met Tysons mother Lorna Mae Smith Tyson. Kirkpatrick frequented pool halls gambled and hung out on the streets. My father was just a regular street guy caught up in the street world Tyson said. Kirkpatrick abandoned the Tyson family around the time Mike was born leaving Tysons mother to care for the children on her own. 26 Kirkpatrick died in 1992. 27 The family lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant until their financial burdens necessitated a move to Brownsville when Tyson was 10 years old. 28 Throughout his childhood Tyson lived in and around neighborhoods with a high rate of crime. According to an interview in Details his first fight was with a bigger youth who had pulled the head off one of Tysons pigeons. 29 Tyson was repeatedly caught committing petty crimes and fighting those who ridiculed his high-pitched voice and lisp . By the age of 13 he had been arrested 38 times. 30 He ended up at the Tryon School for Boys in Johnstown New York. Tysons emerging boxing ability was discovered there by Bobby Stewart a juvenile detention center counselor and former boxer. Stewart considered Tyson to be an outstanding fighter and trained him for a few months before introducing him to boxing manager and trainer Cus DAmato . 26 Tyson dropped out of high school as a junior. 31 He was later awarded an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Central State University in 1989. 32 Kevin Rooney also trained Tyson and he was occasionally assisted by Teddy Atlas although Atlas was dismissed by DAmato when Tyson was 15. Rooney eventually took over all training duties for the young fighter. 33 Tysons mother died when he was 16 leaving him in the care of DAmato who would become his legal guardian. Tyson later said I never saw my mother happy with me and proud of me for doing something: she only knew me as being a wild kid running the streets coming home with new clothes that she knew I didnt pay for. I never got a chance to talk to her or know about her. Professionally it has no effect but its crushing emotionally and personally. 34 Amateur career As an amateur Tyson won gold medals at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympic Games defeating Joe Cortez in 1981 and beating Kelton Brown in 1982. Browns corner threw in the towel in the first round. In 1984 Tyson won the gold medal at the Nation Golden Gloves held in New York beating Jonathan Littles. 35 He fought Henry Tillman twice as an amateur losing both bouts by decision. Tillman went on to win heavyweight gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. 36 Professional career Early career Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6 1985 in Albany New York . He defeated Hector Mercedes via first-round TKO. 26 He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting frequently Tyson won 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round. 37 The quality of his opponents gradually increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders 37 like James Tillis David Jaco Jesse Ferguson Mitch Green and Marvis Frazier . His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great heavyweight champion. DAmato died in November 1985 relatively early into Tysons professional career and some speculate that his death was the catalyst to many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career progressed. 38 Rise up the ranks Tysons first nationally televised bout took place on February 16 1986 at Houston Field House in Troy New York against journeyman heavyweight Jesse Ferguson and was carried by ABC Sports . Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that broke Fergusons nose. 39 During the sixth round Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his commands to box the referee finally stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification DQ of his opponent. The ruling was adjusted to a win by technical knockout TKO after Tysons corner protested that a DQ win would end Tysons string of knockout victories and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result. In July after recording six more knockout victories Tyson fought former world title challenger Marvis Frazier in Glens Falls New York on another ABC Sports broadcast. Tyson won easily charging at Frazier at the opening bell and hitting him with two consecutive uppercuts the second of which knocked Frazier unconscious thirty seconds into the fight. 40 After his win over Frazier Tyson was booked to fight Jose Ribalta at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City New Jersey in 1986. 41 Ribalta would hit Tyson in the body throughout the fight. Tyson knocked down Ribalta three times in the 2nd 8th and 10th round when the referee called the fight off. Tyson would go on to say that Ribalta was his toughest fight commenting I hit Jose Ribalta with everything and he took everything and kept coming back for more. Jose Ribalta stood toe to toe with me. He was very strong in the clinches and Ribalta was a game fighter who actually engaged me. I felt nauseous from all Ribaltas body blows even hours after the fight. I never felt that much general pain again. 41 WBC heavyweight champion Tyson vs. Berbick See also: Trevor Berbick vs. Mike Tyson On November 22 1986 Tyson was given his first title fight against Trevor Berbick for the World Boxing Council WBC heavyweight championship. Tyson won the title by TKO in the second round and at the age of 20 years and 4 months became the youngest heavyweight champion in history. 42 He added the WBA and IBF titles after defeating James Smith and Tony Tucker in 1987. Tysons dominant performance brought many accolades. Donald Saunders wrote: The noble and manly art of boxing can at least cease worrying about its immediate future now that it has discovered a heavyweight champion fit to stand alongside Dempsey Tunney Louis Marciano and Ali. 43 Tyson intimidated fighters with his strength combined with outstanding hand speed accuracy coordination and timing. 44 Tyson also possessed notable defensive abilities holding his hands high in the peek-a-boo style taught by his mentor Cus DAmato 45 46 to slip under and weave around his opponents punches while timing his own. 46 Tysons explosive punching technique was due in large part to crouching immediately prior to throwing a hook or an uppercut: this allowed the spring of his legs to add power to the punch. 47 Among his signature moves was a right hook to his opponents body followed by a right uppercut to his opponents chin. Lorenzo Boyd Jesse Ferguson and Jose Ribalta were each knocked down by this combination. 48 Unified heavyweight champion Tyson vs. Smith Thomas See also: Mike Tyson vs. James Smith Expectations for Tyson were extremely high and he was the favorite to win the heavyweight unification series a tournament designed to establish an undisputed heavyweight champion. Tyson defended his title against James Smith on March 7 1987 in Las Vegas Nevada. He won by unanimous decision and added Smiths World Boxing Association WBA title to his existing belt. 49 Tyson-mania in the media was becoming rampant. 50 He beat Pinklon Thomas in May by TKO in the sixth round. 51 Undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson on the cover of El Grafico in 1988 Tyson vs. Tucker See also: Mike Tyson vs. Tony Tucker On August 1 he took the International Boxing Federation IBF title from Tony Tucker in a twelve-round unanimous decision 119111 118113 and 116112. 52 He became the first heavyweight to own all three major belts WBA WBC and IBF at the same time. Tyson vs. Biggs Holmes Tubbs Another fight in October of that year ended with a victory for Tyson over 1984 Olympic super heavyweight gold medalist Tyrell Biggs by TKO in the seventh round. 53 Tyson knocks down Biggs in the seventh round of their championship bout in 1987 During this time Tyson came to the attention of gaming company Nintendo . After witnessing one of Tysons fights Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa was impressed by the fighters power and skill prompting him to suggest Tyson be included in the upcoming Nintendo Entertainment System port of the Punch-Out!! arcade game. In 1987 Nintendo released Mike Tysons Punch-Out!! which was well received and sold more than a million copies. 54 Tyson had three fights in 1988. He faced Larry Holmes on January 22 1988 and defeated the legendary former champion by KO in the fourth round. 55 This was the only knockout loss Holmes had in 75 professional bouts. In March Tyson then fought contender Tony Tubbs in Tokyo Japan fitting in an easy second-round TKO victory amid promotional and marketing work. 56 Tyson vs. Spinks See also: Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks On June 27 1988 Tyson faced Michael Spinks . Spinks who had taken the heavyweight championship from Larry Holmes via fifteen-round decision in 1985 had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing organizations. Holmes had previously given up all but the IBF title and that was eventually stripped from Spinks after he elected to fight Gerry Cooney winning by TKO in the fifth round rather than IBF Number 1 Contender Tony Tucker as the Cooney fight provided him a larger purse. However Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many including Ring magazine considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion. 57 The bout was at the time the richest fight in history and expectations were very high. Boxing pundits were predicting a titanic battle of styles with Tysons aggressive infighting conflicting with Spinkss skillful out-boxing and footwork. The fight ended after 91 seconds when Tyson knocked Spinks out in the first round; many consider this to be the pinnacle of Tysons fame and boxing ability. 58 59 During this period Tysons problems outside the ring were also beginning to emerge. His marriage to Robin Givens was heading for divorce 60 and his future contract was being fought over by Don King and Bill Cayton . 61 In late 1988 Tyson parted with manager Bill Cayton and fired longtime trainer Kevin Rooney the man many credit for honing Tysons craft after the death of DAmato. 46 Following Rooneys departure critics alleged that Tyson began to show less head movement and combination punching. 62 63 Tyson vs. Bruno Carl Williams In 1989 Tyson had only two fights amid personal turmoil. He faced the British boxer Frank Bruno in February. Bruno managed to stun Tyson at the end of the first round 64 although Tyson went on to knock Bruno out in the fifth round. Tyson then knocked out Carl The Truth Williams in the first round in July. 65 Tyson vs. Douglas See also: Mike Tyson vs. Buster Douglas By 1990 Tyson seemed to have lost direction and his personal life was in disarray amidst reports of less vigorous training prior to the Buster Douglas match. 66 In a fight on February 11 1990 he lost the undisputed championship to Douglas in Tokyo. 67 Tyson was a huge betting favorite; indeed the Mirage the only casino to put out odds for the fight made Tyson a 421 favorite. Tyson failed to find a way past Douglass quick jab that had a 12-inch 30 cm reach advantage over his own. 68 Tyson did catch Douglas with an uppercut in the eighth round and knocked him to the floor but Douglas recovered sufficiently to hand Tyson a heavy beating in the subsequent two rounds. After the fight the Tyson camp would complain that the count was slow and that Douglas had taken longer than ten seconds to get back on his feet. 69 Just 35 seconds into the tenth round Douglas unleashed a brutal uppercut followed by a four-punch combination of hooks that knocked Tyson down for the first time in his career. He was counted out by referee Octavio Meyran . 67 The knockout victory by Douglas over Tyson the previously undefeated baddest man on the planet and arguably the most feared boxer in professional boxing at that time has been described as one of the most shocking upsets in modern sports history. 70 Return to the ring Main articles: Mike Tyson vs. Henry Tillman and Mike Tyson vs. Alex Stewart Despite the shocking loss Tyson has said that losing to Douglas was the greatest moment of his career: I needed that fight to make me a better person and fighter. I have a broader perspective of myself and boxing. 71 After the loss Tyson recovered with first-round knockouts of Henry Tillman 72 and Alex Stewart 73 in his next two fights. Tysons victory over Tillman the 1984 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist enabled Tyson to avenge his amateur losses at Tillmans hands. These bouts set up an elimination match for another shot at the undisputed world heavyweight championship which Evander Holyfield had taken from Douglas in his first defense of the title. 74 Tyson vs. Ruddock Main article: Mike Tyson vs. Donovan Ruddock Tyson who was the number one contender faced number two contender Donovan Razor Ruddock on March 18 1991 in Las Vegas. Ruddock was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight around and was thought of as one of the hardest punching heavyweights. Tyson and Ruddock went back and forth for most of the fight until referee Richard Steele controversially stopped the fight during the seventh round in favor of Tyson. This decision infuriated the fans in attendance sparking a post-fight melee in the audience. The referee had to be escorted from the ring. 75 Tyson vs Ruddock II Main article: Mike Tyson vs. Donovan Ruddock II Tyson and Ruddock met again on June 28 that year with Tyson knocking down Ruddock twice and winning a twelve-round unanimous decision 113109 114108 and 114108. 76 A fight between Tyson and Holyfield for the undisputed championship was scheduled for November 8 1991 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas but Tyson pulled out after sustaining a rib cartilage injury during training. 77 Trial and incarceration Tyson was arrested in July 1991 for the rape of 18-year-old Desiree Washington at the Canterbury Hotel in Indianapolis . Washington who had previously been crowned Miss Black Rhode Island 78 was a contestant in the Miss Black America pageant rehearsals for which were being held in the city. Tyson was charged with one count of rape two counts of criminal deviate conduct and one count of criminal confinementcharges that carried a maximum sentence of 63 years. 79 Tysons rape trial at the Marion County superior court lasted from January 26 to February 10 1992. 80 Washington herself testified that Tyson had called her around 1:45 a.m. to tour the city then picked her up in his limo took her back to his room and made small talk as they both sat on the bed. 79 After propositioning her for sex Washington stated that she firmly refused and went to use the bathroom before leaving. After using the bathroom she said she noticed some discharge on her panty shield. Washington said she removed the liner and threw it away. 79 When she came out Tyson then pulled her to the bed pinned her down and raped her she testified. He was mean evil she said. I got on top and started to try to get away but he slammed me down again. . 79 Three days after the assault Washington went to the police and accused Tyson of rape. 78 Partial corroboration of Washingtons story came via testimony from Tysons chauffeur Virginia Foster who confirmed Desiree Washingtons state of shock 79 after the incident. Foster also testified that Tyson had previously attempted to sexually assault her too having lured her to his hotel room tried to touch her and then exposed himself . 79 Further testimony came from the emergency room physician Dr. Thomas Richardson who examined Washington after the incident and confirmed that Washingtons physical condition was consistent with rape. 81 Richardson testified that Washington had suffered two small vaginal abrasions consistent with 20 to 30 percent of the injuries seen in sexual assault cases 79 and that in approximately 20 000 cases over a period of 20 years only twice ... had he ever seen such abrasions following consensual sex. 79 Under lead defense lawyer Vincent J. Fuller s direct examination Tyson claimed that everything had taken place with Washingtons full consent and he claimed not to have forced himself upon her. When he was cross-examined by lead prosecutor Gregory Garrison Tyson denied claims that he had misled Washington and insisted that she wanted to have sex with him. 82 In a misguided attempt to show that Washington must have known that Tyson wanted sex the defense called witness after witness to testify about their clients lewd remarks and crude behavior during his encounters with the Miss Black America contestants and even with Washington herself. 79 Former attorney Mark Shaw argued that Tysons case was mishandled citing a jury-selection process that allowed a conservative ex-Marine to become foreman a defense strategy of making Tyson look as bad as possible and a disastrous decision to allow the defendant to testify at the grand jury hearing the trial and his sentencing. 79 Despite Fullers reputation as one of the most skillful and respected defense attorneys not only in Washington but in the country ... the defense team embarked on a game plan filled with ill-fated decisions and questionable strategies. ... While the famous Fuller seemed to give Tyson an imposing advantage his background made him an illogical choice. ... Though hed represented such notables as John Hinckley Jr. and junk-bond king Michael Milken his reputation came mostly from federal court white-collar cases such as tax fraud and bribery. He simply wasnt familiar with the rough-and-tumble county criminal courts and lacked recent experience in sex-crime cases. He couldnt locate exhibits fumbled his delivery exhibited a lack of knowledge of Indiana law and generally handled Tysons defense more like a first-year law student than a seasoned pro. 79 Fuller had also successfully defended Tysons manager Don King against federal tax-evasion charges 83 in 1985 which may have been one of the reasons King chose him to represent Tyson. Tyson himself would later describe Fuller as a horrible lawyer . 84 According to Shaw Fuller never challenged obvious problems in Washingtons story. Exactly why did she remove her panty shield? How did Tyson perform oral sex on her and still keep her pinned to the bed? If Tyson is one of the strongest men in the world where were the bruises on the 108-pound woman? 79 Tyson was convicted of the rape charge on February 10 1992 after the jury deliberated for nearly 10 hours. 85 Alan Dershowitz acting as Tysons counsel filed an appeal urging error of law in the Courts exclusion of evidence of the victims past sexual conduct known as the Rape Shield Law ; Dershowtiz alleged that Washington had falsely accused one of her high school classmates of rape 86 the exclusion of three potential defense witnesses and the lack of jury instructions on honest and reasonable mistake of fact . 87 The Indiana Court of Appeals ruled against Tyson in a 21 vote. 87 The Indiana Supreme Court let the lower court opinion stand due to a 22 split in its review. The tie vote was due to the fact that the Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard recused himself from the case. The Chief Justice later revealed he did so because of a heated argument between his wife and Dershowitz at a Yale Law School reunion concerning the case. 88 On March 26 1992 Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison along with four years of probation. 89 He was assigned to the Indiana Youth Center now the Plainfield Correctional Facility in April 1992 90 and he was released in March 1995 after serving less than three years of the sentence. 91 He left with prison tattoos of tennis player Arthur Ashe and Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong ; Tyson also dates his tattoo of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara to this time. 92 93 Due to his conviction Tyson was required to register as a Tier II sex offender under federal law. 94 95 96 Tyson has continued to maintain his innocence. In 1992 Erinn Cosby the daughter of comedian and actor Bill Cosby publicly accused Tyson of sexually assaulting her in 1989 although no criminal charges were ever sought. 97 Comeback Main articles: Mike Tyson vs. Peter McNeeley Mike Tyson vs. Buster Mathis Jr. Frank Bruno vs. Mike Tyson II and Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson After being paroled from prison Tyson easily won his comeback bouts against Peter McNeeley and Buster Mathis Jr. Tysons first comeback fight was marketed as Hes back! 41 and grossed more than US96 million worldwide including a United States record 63 million for PPV television. The viewing of the fight was purchased by 1.52 million homes setting both PPV viewership and revenue records. 98 The 89-second fight elicited criticism that Tysons management lined up tomato cans to ensure easy victories for his return. 99 TV Guide included the TysonMcNeeley fight in their list of the 50 Greatest TV Sports Moments of All Time in 1998. 100 Second reign as unified heavyweight champion Tyson vs. Bruno II Seldon Tyson regained one belt by easily winning the WBC title against Frank Bruno in March 1996. It was the second fight between the two and Tyson knocked out Bruno in the third round. 101 In 1996 Lennox Lewis turned down a 13.5 million guarantee to fight Tyson. This wouldve been Lewiss highest fight purse to date. Lewis then accepted 4 million from Don King to step aside and allow Tyson to fight Bruce Seldon for an expected 30 million instead with the intention that if Tyson defeated Seldon he would fight Lewis next. 102 Tyson added the WBA belt by defeating champion Seldon in the first round in September that year. Seldon was severely criticized and mocked in the popular press for seemingly collapsing to innocuous punches from Tyson. 103 Tyson vs. Holyfield Main article: Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield Tyson attempted to defend the WBA title against Evander Holyfield who was in the fourth fight of his own comeback. Holyfield had retired in 1994 following the loss of his championship to Michael Moorer . It was said that Don King and others saw former champion Holyfield who was 34 at the time of the fight and a huge underdog as a washed-up fighter. 104 On November 9 1996 in Las Vegas Nevada Tyson faced Holyfield in a title bout dubbed Finally . In a surprising turn of events Holyfield who was given virtually no chance to win by numerous commentators 105 defeated Tyson by TKO when referee Mitch Halpern stopped the bout in round eleven. 106 Holyfield became the second boxer to win a heavyweight championship belt three times. Holyfields victory was marred by allegations from Tysons camp of Holyfields frequent headbutts 107 during the bout. Although the headbutts were ruled accidental by the referee 107 they would become a point of contention in the rematch. 108 Post-title career Tyson vs. Holyfield II Main article: Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II Tyson and Holyfield fought again on June 28 1997. Originally Halpern was supposed to be the referee but after Tysons camp protested Halpern stepped aside in favor of Mills Lane . 109 The highly anticipated rematch was dubbed The Sound and the Fury and it was held at the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena site of the first bout. It was a lucrative event drawing even more attention than the first bout and grossing 100 million. Tyson received 30 million and Holyfield 35 million the highest paid professional boxing purses until 2007. 110 111 The fight was purchased by 1.99 million households setting a pay-per-view buy rate record that stood until May 5 2007 being surpassed by Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr. 111 112 Soon to become one of the most controversial events in modern sports 113 the fight was stopped at the end of the third round with Tyson disqualified 114 for biting Holyfield on both ears. The first time Tyson bit him the match was temporarily stopped. Referee Mills Lane deducted two points from Tyson and the fight resumed. However after the match resumed Tyson bit him again resulting in his disqualification and Holyfield won the match. The first bite was severe enough to remove a piece of Holyfields right ear which was found on the ring floor after the fight. 115 Tyson later stated that his actions were retaliation for Holyfield repeatedly headbutting him without penalty. 108 In the confusion that followed the ending of the bout and announcement of the decision a near riot occurred in the arena and several people were injured. 116 Tyson Holyfield II was the first heavyweight title fight in over 50 years to end in a disqualification. 117 As a fallout from the incident US3 million was immediately withheld from Tysons 30-million purse by the Nevada state boxing commission the most it could legally hold back at the time. 118 Two days after the fight Tyson issued a statement 119 apologizing to Holyfield for his actions and asked not to be banned for life over the incident. 120 Tyson was roundly condemned in the news media but was not without defenders. Novelist and commentator Katherine Dunn wrote a column that criticized Holyfields sportsmanship in the controversial bout and charged the news media with being biased against Tyson. 121 On July 9 1997 Tysons boxing license was rescinded by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in a unanimous voice vote; he was also fined US3 million and ordered to pay the legal costs of the hearing. 122 As most state athletic commissions honor sanctions imposed by other states this effectively made Tyson unable to box in the United States. The revocation was not permanent as the commission voted 41 to restore Tysons boxing license on October 18 1998. 123 During his time away from boxing in 1998 Tyson made a guest appearance at WrestleMania XIV as an enforcer for the main event match between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin . During this time Tyson was also an unofficial member of Michaelss stable D-Generation X . Tyson was paid 3 million for being guest enforcer of the match at WrestleMania XIV. 124 Main articles: Mike Tyson vs. Francois Botha and Mike Tyson vs. Andrew Golota Im the best ever. Im the most brutal and vicious the most ruthless champion there has ever been. Theres no one can stop me. Lennox is a conqueror? No! Im Alexander ! Hes no Alexander! Im the best ever. Theres never been anyone as ruthless. Im Sonny Liston . Im Jack Dempsey . Theres no one like me. Im from their cloth. There is no one who can match me. My style is impetuous my defense is impregnable and Im just ferocious. I want your heart! I want to eat his children! Praise be to Allah! Tysons post-fight interview after knocking out Lou Savarese 38 seconds into the bout in June 2000. 125 In January 1999 Tyson returned to the ring for a match against the South African Francois Botha . This match also ended in controversy. While Botha initially controlled the fight Tyson allegedly attempted to break Bothas arms during a tie-up and both boxers were cautioned by the referee in the ill-tempered bout. Botha was ahead on points on all scorecards and was confident enough to mock Tyson as the fight continued. Nonetheless Tyson landed a straight right hand in the fifth round that knocked out Botha. 126 Critics noticed Tyson stopped using the bob and weave defense altogether following this return. 127 Promoting the fight on Secaucus New Jersey television station WWOR-TV Tyson launched into an expletive-laden tirade that forced sports anchor Russ Salzberg to cut the interview short. 128 Legal problems arose with Tyson once again.
