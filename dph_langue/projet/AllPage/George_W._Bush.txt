He later co-owned the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball before being elected governor of Texas in 1994 . As governor Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform increased education funding set higher standards for schools and reformed the criminal justice system. He also helped make Texas the leading producer of wind-generated electricity in the United States. In the 2000 presidential election he won over Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore while losing the popular vote after a narrow and contested Electoral College win which involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida . In office Bush signed a major tax-cut program and an education-reform bill the No Child Left Behind Act . He pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based initiatives . He also initiated the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in 2003 to address the AIDS epidemic . The terrorist attacks on September 11 2001 decisively reshaped his administration resulting in the start of the war on terror and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security . Bush ordered the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan in an effort to overthrow the Taliban destroy al-Qaeda and capture Osama bin Laden . He signed the Patriot Act to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. He also ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq on the inaccurate belief that Saddam Hussein s regime possessed weapons of mass destruction and had ties with al-Qaeda . Bush later signed the Medicare Modernization Act which created Medicare Part D . In 2004 Bush was re-elected president in a close race beating Democratic opponent John Kerry and winning the popular vote. During his second term Bush made free trade agreements . He appointed John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws but both efforts failed in Congress. Bush was widely criticized for his handling of Hurricane Katrina and the midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys . Amid his unpopularity the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections . The Afghanistan and Iraq wars continued; in January 2007 Bush launched a surge of troops in Iraq . By December the U.S. entered the Great Recession prompting the Bush administration to get congressional approval for economic programs intended to preserve the countrys financial system including the Troubled Asset Relief Program . After his second term Bush returned to Texas where he has maintained a low public profile. At various points in his presidency he was among both the most popular and the most unpopular presidents in U.S. history. He received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks and one of the lowest ratings during the 20072008 financial crisis . Although Bushs presidency has generally been rated as below average by scholars public opinion of him has improved since he left office. Early life and career Main article: Early life of George W. Bush George W. Bush with his parents Barbara and George H. W. Bush c. 1947 George Walker Bush was born on July 6 1946 at Grace-New Haven Hospital in New Haven Connecticut . 1 He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce .

He graduated in 1975 with an MBA degree and is the only U.S. president to have earned an MBA. 16 Family and personal life See also: Bush family Bush was engaged to Cathryn Lee Wolfman in 1967 but the engagement did not last. Bush and Wolfman remained on good terms after the end of the relationship. 17 While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977 friends introduced him to Laura Welch a schoolteacher and librarian. After a three-month courtship she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year. 18 The couple settled in Midland Texas. Bush left his familys Episcopal Church to join his wifes United Methodist Church . 19 On November 25 1981 Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters Barbara and Jenna . 18 Bush describes being challenged by Billy Graham to consider faith in Jesus Christ as the risen Lord how he began to read the Bible daily surrendering to the Almighty that faith is a walk and that he was moved by Gods love . 20 Alcohol abuse Before his marriage Bush repeatedly abused alcohol . 21 On September 4 1976 he was pulled over near his familys summer home in Kennebunkport Maine for driving under the influence of alcohol . He was arrested for DUI was fined 150 and received a brief suspension of his Maine drivers license. 22 Bush has said his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life 18 and he attributes his decision to give up alcohol in 1986 to her influence. 23 While governor of Texas Bush said of his wife I saw an elegant beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges and I must confess has smoothed them off over time. 18 Bush also says that his faith in God was critical in abstaining. I believe that God helped open my eyes which were closing because of booze . 20 Hobbies Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life preferring biographies and histories. 24 During his presidency Bush read the Bible daily 25 though at the end of his second term he said on television that he is not a literalist about Bible interpretation. 26 27 Walt Harrington a journalist recalled seeing books by John Fowles F. Scott Fitzgerald James Joyce and Gore Vidal lying about as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other activities include cigar smoking and golf. 28 Bush has also painted many paintings. One of his best-known projects is a collection of 43 paintings of immigrants titled Out of Many One . 29 Another painting project was Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chiefs Tribute to Americas Warrior . 30 Military career Main article: George W. Bush military service controversy See also: Killian documents controversy and Killian documents authenticity issues In May 1968 Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard . 31 After two years of training in active-duty service 32 he was assigned to Houston flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base . 31 33 Critics including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his fathers political standing as a member of the House of Representatives citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance. 31 In June 2005 the Department of Defense released all the records of Bushs Texas Air National Guard service which remain in its official archives. 34 In late 1972 and early 1973 he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard . He had moved to Montgomery Alabama to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount . 35 36 In 1972 Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam. 37 He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21 1974. 38 Bush remains the most recent president to have served in the military. 39 Business career Main article: Professional life of George W. Bush Bush and former President Gerald Ford in August 1984 In 1977 Bush established Arbusto Energy a small oil exploration company which began operations in 1978. 40 41 He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984 his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7 and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices and it folded into Harken Energy Corporation 42 with Bush becoming a member of Harkens board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving Harken arose but a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading. 43 In April 1989 Bush arranged for a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest of Major League Baseballs Texas Rangers for 89 million and invested 500 000 himself to start. He then was managing general partner for five years. 44 He actively led the teams projects and regularly attended its games often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans. 45 Bushs sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over 15 million from his initial 800 000 investment. 46 In the early or mid 1990s before his gubernatorial campaign Bush briefly considered a candidacy to become the Commissioner of Baseball . 47 48 49 Early political involvement In 1978 Bush ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from Texass 19th congressional district . The retiring member George H. Mahon had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bushs opponent Kent Hance portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans and Bush lost the election receiving 46.8 percent of the vote to Hances 53.2 percent. 50 Bush and his family moved to Washington D.C. in 1988 to work on his fathers campaign for the U.S. presidency . 51 52 He was a campaign advisor and liaison to the media and assisted his father by campaigning across the country. 53 In December 1991 Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his fathers 1992 presidential re-election campaign as a campaign advisor. 54 The previous month his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu to resign. 55 Texas governorship 19952000 Main article: Governorship of George W. Bush Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time his brother Jeb sought the governorship in Florida . His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform tort reform crime reduction and education improvement. 53 Bushs campaign advisers were Karen Hughes Joe Allbaugh and Karl Rove . 56 Governor Bush right with father former president George H. W. Bush and wife Laura at the dedication of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum 1997 After easily winning the Republican primary Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards . 53 57 In the course of the campaign Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons . Richards had vetoed the bill but Bush signed it into law after he became governor. 58 According to The Atlantic the race featured a rumor that she was a lesbian along with a rare instance of such a tactics making it into the public record when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself perhaps inadvertently to be quoted criticizing Richards for appointing avowed homosexual activists to state jobs . 59 The Atlantic and others connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove 60 but Rove denied being involved. 61 Bush won the general election with 53.5 percent of the vote against Richards 45.9 percent. 62 Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texass largest tax cut 2 billion. 56 He extended government funding for organizations providing education on the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse and helping to reduce domestic violence . 63 His administration lowered the age at which juveniles can be sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14. 64 Bush presided over 152 executions 65 more than any previous governor in modern American history; critics such as Helen Prejean argue that he failed to give serious consideration to clemency requests. 66 67 Critics also contended that during his tenure Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores. 53 In 1999 Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources RPS 68 69 70 which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S. 71 72 In 1998 Bush won re-election with a record 53 69 percent of the vote. 73 He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms. 53 In his second term Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings which peaked at 81 percent in 1999. 53 74 He proclaimed June 10 2000 to be Jesus Day in Texas a day on which he urged all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need . 75 Throughout Bushs first term he was the focus of national attention as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election speculation soared and within a year he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. 53 Presidential campaigns 2000 presidential candidacy Main articles: George W. Bush 2000 presidential campaign 2000 Republican Party presidential primaries and 2000 United States presidential election Primary Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House increasing the size of the military cutting taxes improving education and aiding minorities. 53 By early 2000 the race had centered on Bush and Arizona Senator John McCain . 53 Bush won the Iowa caucuses and although heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary trailed McCain by 19 percent and lost. Despite this he regained momentum and effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary which according to The Boston Globe made history for his campaigns negativity. The New York Times described it as a smear campaign . 76 77 78 General election 2000 electoral vote results On July 25 2000 Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney a former White House chief of staff U.S. representative and secretary of defense to be his running mate. At the time Cheney was serving as head of Bushs vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party. 79 Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas. 53 During his campaign Bush criticized his Democratic opponent incumbent Vice President Al Gore over gun control and taxation. 80 When the election returns were tallied on November 7 Bush had won 29 states including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount . 53 The initial recount also went to Bush but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court . 81 On December 9 in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling 82 the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Floridas counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . 53 The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million casts. 83 Although he had received 543 895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore Bush won the election receiving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266 Gore had actually been awarded 267 votes by the states pledged to him plus the District of Columbia but one D.C. elector abstained. Bush was the first person to win a U.S. presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888. 83 2004 presidential candidacy Main articles: George W. Bush 2004 presidential campaign and 2004 United States presidential election 2004 electoral vote results George W. Bush re-election campaign stop in Grand Rapids Michigan October 2004 In his 2004 bid for re-election Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager and Karl Rove devised a political strategy. 84 Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan 85 support for the USA PATRIOT Act 86 a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage 85 87 reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts 85 creation of an ownership society 85 and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls. 88 Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants 85 which was criticized by conservatives. 89 The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates including Bushs emerging opponent Massachusetts Senator John Kerry . Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerrys seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq 53 and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror. Following the resignation of CIA director George Tenet in 2004 Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration. 90 After Goss appointment many of the CIAs senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election. 91 In the election Bush carried 31 of 50 states receiving 286 electoral votes. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote 50.7 percent to Kerrys 48.3 percent. 92 Presidency 20012009 Main article: Presidency of George W. Bush For a chronological guide see Timeline of the George W. Bush presidency . See also: List of George W. Bush legislation and programs Bush on January 20 2001 in Washington D.C. the day of his first inauguration as President of the United States Bush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 attacks . 93 Wars were begun in Afghanistan and Iraq and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration healthcare Social Security economic policy and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period Bushs once-high approval ratings 94 steadily declined while his disapproval numbers increased significantly. 95 In 2007 the United States entered the longest post- World War II recession. 96 Domestic policy Main article: Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration Economic policy Main article: Economic policy of the George W. Bush administration Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble . 97 The September 11 terrorist attacks also impacted the economy . His administration increased federal government spending from 1.789 trillion to 2.983 trillion 66 percent while revenues increased from 2.025 trillion to 2.524 trillion from 2000 to 2008. Individual income tax revenues increased by 14 percent corporate tax revenues by 50 percent and customs and duties by 40 percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107 percent discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent Medicare spending by 131 percent social security by 51 percent and income security spending by 130 percent. Cyclically adjusted revenues rose by 35 percent and spending by 65 percent. 98 The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson . 99 The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91 196. 100 The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was 237 billion the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever. 101 In 2001 Bushs budget estimated that there would be a 5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years. 102 Facing congressional opposition Bush held town hall-style meetings across the U.S. to increase public support for his plan for a 1.35 trillion tax cut program one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. 53 Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers saying the surplus is not the governments money. The surplus is the peoples money. 53 Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. 103 Treasury Secretary Paul H. ONeill opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security . 104 ONeill disputes the claim made in Bushs book Decision Points that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. 105 By 2003 the economy showed signs of improvement though job growth remained stagnant. 53 Another tax cut was passed that year. 106 Between 2001 and 2008 GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125 percent 107 less than for past business cycles. 108 Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10 587 and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14 000. When Bush left office the average was at 7 949 one of the lowest levels of his presidency. 109 Only four other U.S. presidents have left office with the stock market lower than when they began. 110 Deficit and debt increases from 2001 to 2009. Gross debt increased over 500 billion each year after the 2003 fiscal year. Unemployment originally rose from 4.2 percent in January 2001 to 6.3 percent in June 2003 but subsequently dropped to 4.5 percent in July 2007. 111 Adjusted for inflation median household income dropped by 1 175 between 2000 and 2007 112 while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that Median real after-tax household income went up two percent . 113 The poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.3 percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7 percent in 2004. 114 By October 2008 due to increases in spending 115 : 273 the national debt had risen to 11.3 trillion 116 more than doubling it since 2000. 117 118 unreliable source? Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the Bush tax cuts and increased national security spending. 119 In March 2006 then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling : The fact that we are here today to debate raising Americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. 120 By the end of Bushs presidency unemployment climbed to 7.2 percent. 121 2008 financial crisis In December 2007 the United States entered the longest post World War II recession 96 caused by a housing market correction a subprime mortgage crisis soaring oil prices and other factors. In February 2008 63 000 jobs were lost a five-year record 122 and in November over 500 000 jobs were lost which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years. 123 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008 1.9 million jobs were lost. 124 By the end of 2008 the U.S. had lost 2.6 million jobs. 125 To aid with the situation Bush signed a 170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. 126 The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003 127 and after two years the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators as well as influential members of the Bush Administration feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sectors risky practices. 128 129 130 In September 2008 the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for 85 billion. 131 Many economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . 132 133 Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan . 134 Bush meanwhile proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market. 135 Vince Reinhardt a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute said it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely and additionally that it would have helped for Congress to have held hearings . 129 Education and public health Bush undertook many educational agendas such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006 the first such cut in 36 years due to rising inflation. 136 President Bush signing the No Child Left Behind Act into law January 8 2002 One of the administrations early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. 137 It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002. 138 Many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed No Child Left Behind into law. 139 Critics who? argue that it is underfunded 140 better source needed and that NCLBAs focus on high-stakes testing and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive. 141 On November 1 2005 Bush launched a National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza which culminated in an implementation plan published by the Homeland Security Council in May 2006. 142 143 After being re-elected Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that according to Jan Crawford resulted in the greatest expansion in Americas welfare state in forty years the bills costs approached 7 trillion. 115 : 274 In 2007 Bush opposed and vetoed State Childrens Health Insurance Program SCHIP legislation which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded healthcare benefits and plans to children of some low-income families. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax. 144 Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as 83 000 per year who did not need the help. 145 On May 21 2008 Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act aimed to protect Americans against health insurance and employment discrimination based on a persons genetic information. The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research. 146 147 Social services and Social Security Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003 Bush signed the bill which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits. 148 The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law estimated to cost 400 billion over the first ten years would give the elderly better choices and more control over their health care . 149 Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social Security 150 which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress. 150 In his 2005 State of the Union Address Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program which included partial privatization of the system personal Social Security accounts and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax FICA into secured investments. 150 Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system. 150 Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour campaigning for his initiative in media events known as Conversations on Social Security in an attempt to gain public support. 151 Nevertheless public support for the proposal declined 152 and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda. 153 The proposals legislative prospects were further diminished by autumn 2005 due to political fallout from the response to Hurricane Katrina . 154 Environmental policies Main article: Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration Environment Upon taking office in 2001 Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the worlds population 155 and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year. 156 He also cited that the Senate had voted 950 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol. In May 2001 Bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects 157 and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues. 158 In 2002 Bush proposed the Clear Skies Act of 2003 159 which aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal. 160 The initiative was introduced to Congress but failed to make it out of committee. citation needed Later in 2006 Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date. The Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres 340 000 km 2 and is home to 7 000 species of fish birds and other marine animals many of which are specific to only those islands. 161 The move was hailed by conservationists for its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area . 162 Bush has said he believes that global warming is real 163 and has noted that it is a serious problem but he asserted there is a debate over whether its man-made or naturally caused . 164 The Bush Administrations stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration 165 misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming. 166 Energy policies In his 2006 State of the Union Address Bush declared America is addicted to oil and launched his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research. 167 Bush delivering a statement urging Congress to end a ban on offshore oil drilling June 18 2008 In his 2007 State of the Union Address Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. 168 Amid high gasoline prices in 2008 Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling . 169 However the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress. 169 Bush had said in June 2008 In the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells ... In the short run the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production. 170 In his 2008 State of the Union Address Bush committed 2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change saying Along with contributions from other countries this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive. He also presented plans to reaffirm the United States commitment to work with major economies and through the UN to complete an international agreement that will slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. 171 Stem cell research and first veto Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage of the DickeyWicker Amendment in 1995. 172 Bush has said he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research. 173 On August 9 2001 Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing lines of stem cells 174 but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines. 175 On July 19 2006 Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act . The bill would have repealed the DickeyWicker Amendment thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo. 176 Immigration President Bush discussing border security with Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff near El Paso November 2005 Nearly eight million immigrants came to the U.S. from 2000 to 2005 more than in any other five-year period in the nations history. 177 Almost half entered illegally. 178 unreliable source? In 2006 Bush urged Congress to allow more than twelve million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a temporary guest-worker program . Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6 000 National Guard troops to the MexicoUnited States border . 179 From May to June 2007 Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration. 180 The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and worksite enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based merit system for green cards; elimination of chain migration and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa ; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor. 181 Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty. 182 A heated public debate followed which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions. 183 The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28 2007 when a cloture motion failed on a 4653 vote. 184 Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. 185 The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law. 186 On September 19 2010 former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100 000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 187 Hurricane Katrina Main article: Political effects of Hurricane Katrina President Bush with hurricane victims in Biloxi September 2 2005 Hurricane Katrina struck early in Bushs second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States particularly New Orleans. 188 Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27 189 and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day. 190 The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29 and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana 191 officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort. On August 30 DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it an incident of national significance 192 triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan . Three days later on September 2 National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans. 193 The same day Bush toured parts of Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was not enough . 194 As the disaster in New Orleans intensified Bush received widespread criticism for downplaying his administrations role in the inadequate response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA notably Michael D. Brown ; 195 federal resources to respond were also limited as a result of being allocated to the Iraq War 196 and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. 197 198 Bush responded to mounting criticism by claiming to accept full responsibility for the federal governments failures in its handling of the emergency. 193 It has been argued that with Katrina Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover. 199 Midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys Main article: Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy President Bush nominating Alberto Gonzales as the next U.S. Attorney General November 10 2004 During Bushs second term a controversy arose over the Justice Departments midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys . 200 The White House maintained that they were fired for poor performance. 201 Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue along with other senior members of the Justice Department. 202 203 The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter but Bush directed Miers and Bolten not to comply with those subpoenas invoking his right of executive privilege . Bush maintained that all his advisers were covered under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the Presidents order was legal. 204 Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage no official findings have been released. On March 10 2008 the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas. 205 On July 31 2008 a United States district court judge ruled that Bushs top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas. 206 In all twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales 207 and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson 208 Gonzales liaison to the White House Monica Goodling 209 aide to the president Karl Rove 210 and his senior aide Sara Taylor . 211 In addition legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers 212 and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten 213 were both found in contempt of Congress . 211 In 2010 the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings 214 the firings were inappropriately political but not criminal. According to the prosecutors there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense. 215 Foreign policy Main article: Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration Countries visited by President George W. Bush during his time in office During his presidential campaign Bushs foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationships with Latin America especially Mexico and a reduction of involvement in nation-building and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a national missile defense . 216 Bush was an advocate of Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization . 217 Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine. 218 In March 2006 Bush visited India in a trip focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy counter-terrorism co-operation and discussions that would eventually lead to the IndiaUnited States Civil Nuclear Agreement . 219 220 This was in stark contrast to decades of U.S. policy such as the stance taken by his predecessor Bill Clinton whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests has been characterized as sanctions and hectoring . 221 Midway through Bushs second term questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia. 222 President Bush with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Shanghai October 21 2001. Russia had cooperated with the U.S. in the war on terror. Bush signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia. He withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements including in 2002 the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ABM with Russia. 223 This marked the first time in post-World War II history that the United States had withdrawn from a major international arms treaty. 224 Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that American withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was a mistake. 225 Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . Bush supported Sharons unilateral disengagement plan and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafats death. Bush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with China over the Hainan Island incident when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a Peoples Liberation Army Air Force jet leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004 Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. 226 Bush said an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur but he opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court . On June 10 2007 Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania. 227 He later voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo . 228 In early 2008 Bush vowed full support for admitting Ukraine and Georgia into NATO 229 despite Russias opposition to the further enlargement of NATO . 230 During the 2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis Bush condemned Russia for recognizing the separatist government of South Ossetia . 231 When Russian troops invaded Georgia later that summer Bush said: Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century. 232 September 11 2001 attacks Main article: September 11 attacks President Bush beside firefighter Bob Beckwith addressing rescue workers at the World Trade Center site The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bushs presidency. That evening he addressed the nation from the Oval Office promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks Bush visited Ground Zero and met with then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani firefighters police officers and volunteers. Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on rubble: I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. 233 President Bush declares freedom at war with fear September 20 2001 Problems playing this file? See media help . In a September 20 speech Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization al-Qaeda and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan where bin Laden was operating to hand over the terrorists or ... share in their fate . 234 The Talibans leader Mullah Omar refused to hand over bin Laden. 235 The continued presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia after the 1991 Gulf War was one of the stated motivations behind the September 11 attacks. In 2003 the U.S. withdrew most of its troops from Saudi Arabia. 236 War on terror Main article: War on terror Countries with major military operations throughout the war on terror launched by Bush including those launched after his presidency In Bushs September 20 speech he declared that our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda but it does not end there. 237 238 In his January 29 2002 State of the Union Address he asserted that an axis of evil consisting of North Korea Iran and Baathist Iraq was arming to threaten the peace of the world and posed a grave and growing danger . 239 The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war or preventive war . 240 This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks. 241 Dissent and criticism of Bushs leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued. 242 243 244 The Iraq war sparked many protests and riots in different parts of the world. 245 In 2006 a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the cause celebre for jihadists . 246 247 Afghanistan invasion Main article: War in Afghanistan 20012021 President Bush and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan in Kabul March 1 2006 On October 7 2001 U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001 the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated 248 but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. 248 Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai . 249 250 Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops. 251 It was not until May 2011 two years after Bush left office that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration. Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping amassing new funds and recruits. 252 The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned. 253 In 2006 the Taliban insurgency appeared larger fiercer and better organized than expected with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. 254 255 256 As a result Bush commissioned 3 500 additional troops to the country in March 2007. 257 Iraq invasion Main article: Iraq War President Bush with Naval Flight Officer Lieutenant Ryan Philips after landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln prior to his Mission Accomplished speech May 1 2003 Beginning with his January 29 2002 State of the Union address Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq which he labeled as part of an axis of evil allied with terrorists and posing a grave and growing danger to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction . 239 258 In the latter half of 2002 CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein s intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. 259 260 Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraqs weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president. 261 262 In late 2002 and early 2003 Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates precipitating a diplomatic crisis . In November 2002 Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. 263 The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries. 264 The Bush administrations claim that the Iraq War was part of the War on Terror had been questioned and contested by political analysts. 265 More than 20 nations most notably the United Kingdom designated the coalition of the willing joined the United States 266 in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital Baghdad fell on April 9 2003. On May 1 Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bushs Mission Accomplished speech was later criticized as premature. 267 From 2004 until 2007 the situation in Iraq deteriorated further with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in Iraq . 268 Bushs policies met with criticism including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group led by James Baker concluded that the situation in Iraq was grave and deteriorating . While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regard to the stability of Iraq 269 he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy. 270 271 According to Iraq Body Count some 251 000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion including at least 163 841 civilians. 272 In January 2005 elections recognized by the West as free and fair were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years. 273 This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as president and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005 supported by most Shiites and many Kurds . 274 On January 10 2007 Bush launched a surge of 21 500 more troops for Iraq as well as a job program for Iraqis more reconstruction proposals and 1.2 billion equivalent to 1.8 billion in 2023 for these programs. 275 On May 1 2007 Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops 276 saying the debate over the conflict was understandable but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial. 277 In March 2008 Bush praised the Iraqi governments bold decision to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army calling it a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq . 278 He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis legislative achievements including a pension law a revised de-Baathification law a new budget an amnesty law and a provincial powers measure that he said set the stage for the Iraqi elections . 279 By July 2008 American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began 280 and due to increased stability in Iraq Bush withdrew of additional American forces. 280 During Bushs last visit to Iraq in December 2008 Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes at him during an official press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki . 281 Al-Zaidi yelled that the shoes were a farewell kiss and for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq . 282 In March 2010 Center for Public Integrity released a report that President Bushs administration had made more than 900 false pretenses in a two-year period about the alleged threat of Iraq against the United States as his rationale to engage in war in Iraq. 283 Surveillance See also: Global surveillance disclosures 2013present Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 Bush issued an executive order that authorized the Presidents Surveillance Program . The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S. and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . 284 As of 2009 update the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. 285 Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists . 286 The program proved to be controversial ; critics of the administration and organizations such as the American Bar Association argued that it was illegal. 287 In August 2006 a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional 288 but on July 6 2007 that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing . 289 On January 17 2007 Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President but would be subjected to judicial oversight. 290 Later in 2007 the NSA launched a replacement for the program referred to as PRISM which was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . 291 This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post 291 and The Guardian 292 emerged in June 2013. 291 Interrogation policies See also: Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture and Torture Memos Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other enhanced interrogation techniques that several critics including Barack Obama would label as torture. 293 294 295 296 Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions ban on torture which was described as an unconstitutional infringement of the Presidents authority to conduct war . 297 298 The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General though that memo was later withdrawn. 299 While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information 297 the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations provided critical information to preserve American lives. 300 Critics such as former CIA officer Bob Baer have stated that information was suspect you can get anyone to confess to anything if the tortures bad enough. 301 On October 17 2006 Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law. 302 The new rule was enacted in the wake of the Supreme Courts decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld 548 U.S. 557 2006 303 which allowed the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denied the detainees access to habeas corpus and barred the torture of prisoners. The provision of the law allowed the president to determine what constitutes torture . 302 On March 8 2008 Bush vetoed H.R. 2082 304 a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations saying that the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror . 305 In April 2009 the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administrations interrogation tactics. 306 One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department. 307 North Korea condemnation Main article: North KoreaUnited States relations Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an axis of evil . He said that the United States of America will not permit the worlds most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the worlds most destructive weapons. 239 Within months both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994. 308 North Koreas October 9 2006 detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bushs foreign policy which centered for both terms of his presidency on preventing the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world . 239 Bush condemned North Koreas position reaffirmed his commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and said that transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States for which North Korea would be held accountable. 309 On May 7 2007 North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. 310 On September 2 2007 North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007. 311 By May 2009 North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea. 312 On June 22 2010 Bush said While South Korea prospers the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly adding that communism had resulted in dire poverty mass starvation and brutal suppression. In recent years he went on to say the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Koreas precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs. 313 Syria sanctions Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria. 314 In 2003 Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act which expanded sanctions on Syria.

Bush See also: Efforts to impeach George W. Bush Image Bushs upbringing in West Texas his accent his vacations on his Texas ranch and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy American cowboy image. 337 338 I think people look at him and think John Wayne said Piers Morgan editor of the British Daily Mirror . 339 Bush has been parodied by the media 340 comedians and other politicians. 341 Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms . 342 In contrast to his father who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks. 343 Tony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is ludicrous and that Bush is very smart . 344 In an interview with Playboy The New York Times columnist David Brooks said Bush was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public. He doesnt want anybody to think hes smarter than they are so puts on a Texas act. 345 unreliable source? Job approval approve disapprove unsure Gallup USA Today Bush public opinion polling from February 2001 to January 2009 Bush began his presidency with approval ratings near 60 percent. 346 After the September 11 attacks Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent 347 maintaining 8090 percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50 percent during most of his first term 348 and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term. 349 In 2000 and again in 2004 Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year a title awarded to someone who the editors believe has done the most to influence the events of the year . 350 In May 2004 Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush. 351 However the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans frustration with him on issues of spending illegal immigration and Middle Eastern affairs. 352 Within the United States armed forces according to an unscientific survey the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections. 353 While 73 percent of military personnel said they would vote for Bush 18 percent preferred his Democratic rival John Kerry . 353 According to Peter Feaver a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq. 353 Bushs approval rating surged to 74 percent at the beginning of the Iraq War up 19 points from his pre-war rating of 55 percent. 354 Bushs approval rating went below the 50 percent mark in AP - Ipsos polling in December 2004. 355 Thereafter his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. After his re-election in 2004 Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum 356 357 358 for his handling of the Iraq War his response to Hurricane Katrina 359 360 361 and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse NSA warrantless surveillance the Plame affair and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies. 362 Amid this criticism the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections . Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37 percent approval ratings for Bush 363 the lowest for any second-term president at that point in his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 when Trumans approval rating was 28 percent 355 364 which contributed to what Bush called the thumping of the Republican Party in the 2006 elections. 365 Throughout most of 2007 Bushs approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties; 366 the average for his entire second term was 37 percent according to Gallup. 367 Protest against the Iraq War in New London Connecticut on May 23 2007 By the beginning of 2008 his final year in office Bushs approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19 percent largely from the loss of support among Republicans. 349 Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being the worst president 368 369 Bush would say I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly dont give a damn about the polls. 370 There were calls for Bushs impeachment though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action. 371 The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy 372 the Bush administrations justification for the war in Iraq and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions . 373 Representative Dennis Kucinich D- OH who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9 2008 but Speaker Nancy Pelosi D- CA declared that impeachment was off the table . 374 In April 2008 Bushs disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup poll with 69 percent of those polled disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving although the majority 66 percent of Republicans still approved of his job performance. 375 In polls conducted in the fall just before the 2008 election his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent 376 377 while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent. 377 378 In polling conducted January 911 2009 his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34 percent which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s Richard Nixon s final Gallup approval rating was even lower at 24 percent. 379 According to a CBS News New York Times poll conducted January 1115 2009 Bushs final approval rating in office was 22 percent the lowest in American history. 376 Foreign perceptions Countries with a U.S. military presence in 2007 Bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization movements for his administrations foreign policy. 380 381 Views of him within the international community even in France a close ally of the United States were more negative than those of most previous American presidents. 382 Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the United Kingdom and Vicente Fox of Mexico although formal relations were sometimes strained. 383 384 385 Other leaders such as Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan 386 Yoweri Museveni of Uganda 387 Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain 388 and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela 389 openly criticized the president. Later in Bushs presidency tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin which led to a cooling of their relationship. 390 In 2006 most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security. 391 392 In 2007 the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency attitudes towards the United States and towards Americans became less favorable around the world. 393 The Pew Research Center s 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that in only nine countries of 47 did most respondents express a lot of confidence or some confidence in Bush: Ethiopia Ghana India Israel Ivory Coast Kenya Mali Nigeria and Uganda. 394 A March 2007 survey of public opinion in six Arab nations conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked world leader. 395 During a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim 396 Albania Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8 million 397 has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan and the countrys government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. 398 A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. 399 400 A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushe-Kruje a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. 401 The Bush administrations support for the unilateral declaration of independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo while endearing him to the Albanians troubled U.S. relations with Serbia leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade . 402 Post-presidency 2009present Residence Former President George W.
