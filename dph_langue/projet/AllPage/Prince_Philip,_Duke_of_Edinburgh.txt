As such he was the consort of the British monarch from his wifes accession on 6 February 1952 until his death in 2021 making him the longest-serving royal consort in history. Philip was born in Greece into the Greek and Danish royal families ; his family was exiled from the country when he was eighteen months old. After being educated in France Germany and the United Kingdom he joined the Royal Navy in 1939 when he was 18 years old. In July 1939 Philip began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth the elder daughter and heir presumptive of King George VI . During the Second World War he served with distinction in the British Mediterranean and Pacific fleets. In the summer of 1946 the King granted Philip permission to marry Elizabeth then aged 20. Before the official announcement of their engagement in July 1947 Philip stopped using his Greek and Danish royal titles and styles became a naturalised British subject and adopted his maternal grandparents surname Mountbatten . In November 1947 he married Elizabeth was granted the style His Royal Highness and was created Duke of Edinburgh Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich . Philip left active military service when Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1952 having reached the rank of commander . In 1957 he was created a British prince . Philip had four children with Elizabeth: Charles Anne Andrew and Edward . A sports enthusiast Philip helped develop the equestrian event of carriage driving . He was patron president or member of over 780 organisations including the World Wide Fund for Nature and served as chairman of The Duke of Edinburghs Award a youth awards programme for people aged 14 to 24. 2 Philip is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family . He retired from royal duties in 2017 aged 96 having completed 22 219 solo engagements and 5 493 speeches since 1952 and died at the age of 99 at Windsor Castle . Early life and education Family infancy and exile from Greece At age one July 1922 Prince Philip Greek : romanized : Philippos 3 of Greece and Denmark was born on 10 June 1921 on the dining room table in Mon Repos a villa on the Greek island of Corfu . 4 He was the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and his wife Princess Alice of Battenberg . 5 Philips father was the fourth son of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece 6 and his mother was the eldest child of Louis Mountbatten 1st Marquess of Milford Haven and Victoria Mountbatten Marchioness of Milford Haven formerly Prince Louis of Battenberg and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. 7 A member of the House of Glucksburg Philip was a prince of both Greece and Denmark by virtue of his patrilineal descent from George I of Greece and Georges father Christian IX of Denmark ; he was from birth in the line of succession to both thrones. fn 2 Philips four elder sisters were Margarita Theodora Cecilie and Sophie . He was baptised in the Greek Orthodox rite at St. Georges Church in the Old Fortress in Corfu . His godparents were his paternal grandmother Queen Olga of Greece; his cousin George Crown Prince of Greece ; his uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten ; and the municipality of Corfu represented by its mayor Alexandros Kokotos. 9 Shortly after Philips birth his maternal grandfather died in London. The Marquess of Milford Haven was a naturalised British subject who after a career in the Royal Navy had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten an Anglicised version of Battenberg during the First World War owing to anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom . After visiting London for his grandfathers memorial service Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained to command a Greek Army division embroiled in the Greco-Turkish War . 10 Greece suffered significant losses in the war and the Turks made substantial gains. Philips uncle and high commander of the Greek expeditionary force King Constantine I was blamed for the defeat and was forced to abdicate in September 1922. The new military government arrested Andrew along with others. General Georgios Hatzianestis who was commanding officer of the army and five senior politicians were arrested tried and executed in the Trial of the Six . Andrews life was also believed to be in danger and Alice was under surveillance. Finally in December a revolutionary court banished Andrew from Greece for life. 11 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Andrews family with Philip carried to safety in a fruit box. 12 Upbringing in France Britain and Germany Philips family settled in a house in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud lent to them by his wealthy aunt Princess George of Greece and Denmark . 12 During his time there Philip was first educated at The Elms an American school in Paris run by Donald MacJannet who described Philip as a know it all smarty person but always remarkably polite . 13 In 1930 Philip was sent to Britain to live with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle George Mountbatten 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven at Lynden Manor in Bray Berkshire . 14 He was then enrolled at Cheam School . 14 Over the next three years his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and placed in an asylum 15 and his father took up residence in Monte Carlo . 16 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood. 17 In 1933 Philip was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany which had the advantage of saving school fees because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law Berthold Margrave of Baden . 18 With the rise of Nazism in Germany Salems Jewish founder Kurt Hahn fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun School in Scotland to which Philip moved after two terms at Salem. 19 In 1937 his sister Cecilie; her husband Georg Donatus Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse ; their two sons; and Georg Donatuss mother were killed in an air crash at Ostend ; Philip then 16 years old attended the funeral in Darmstadt . 20 Cecilie and Georg Donatus were members of the Nazi Party . 21 The following year Philips uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of bone marrow cancer . 22 Milford Havens younger brother Lord Louis took parental responsibility for Philip for the remainder of his youth. 23 Philip did not speak Greek because he had left Greece as an infant. In 1992 he said that he could understand a certain amount . 24 He stated that he thought of himself as Danish and spoke mostly English while his family was multilingual. 24 Known for his charm in his youth Philip was linked to several women including Osla Benning . 25 Naval and wartime service Philip served aboard HMS Valiant in the Battle of the Mediterranean . After leaving Gordonstoun in early 1939 Philip completed a term as a cadet at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth then repatriated to Greece living with his mother in Athens for a month in mid-1939. At the behest of King George II of Greece his first cousin he returned to Britain in September to resume training for the Royal Navy. 26 He graduated from Dartmouth the next year as the best cadet in his course. 27 During the Second World War he continued to serve in the British forces while two of his brothers-in-law Prince Christoph of Hesse and Berthold Margrave of Baden fought on the opposing German side. 28 Philip was appointed as a midshipman in January 1940. He spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent on HMS Shropshire and in British Ceylon . 29 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940 he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet . 30 Philip was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant on 1 February 1941 after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination. 31 32 Among other engagements he was involved in the Battle of Crete and was mentioned in dispatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan in which he controlled the battleships searchlights . He was also awarded the Greek War Cross . 27 In June 1942 he was appointed to the destroyer HMS Wallace which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain as well as the Allied invasion of Sicily . 33 In Melbourne 1945 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942. 34 In October of the same year aged 21 Philip became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace . He was one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. During the invasion of Sicily in July 1943 as second-in-command of Wallace he saved his ship from a night bomber attack. He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed. 33 In 1944 he moved on to the new destroyer HMS Whelp where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla. 35 36 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp in January 1946 and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur the Petty Officers School in Corsham Wiltshire. 37 Marriage Further information: Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten In 1939 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College Dartmouth. During the visit the Queen and Lord Louis Mountbatten asked his nephew Philip to escort the royal couples daughters 13-year-old Elizabeth and 9-year-old Margaret who were Philips third cousins through Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark. 38 Philip and Elizabeth had first met as children in 1934 at the wedding of Elizabeths uncle Prince George Duke of Kent to Philips first cousin Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark . After their 1939 meeting Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters. 39 Eventually in the summer of 1946 Philip asked George VI for his daughters hand in marriage. The King granted his request provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeths 21st birthday the following April. 40 By March 1947 Philip had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mothers family and had stopped using his Greek and Danish royal titles upon becoming a naturalised British subject. The engagement was announced to the public on 9 July 1947. 41 The engagement attracted some controversy; Philip had no financial standing was foreign-born and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links. 42 Marion Crawford wrote: Some of the Kings advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philips foreign origin. 43 Later biographies reported that Elizabeths mother had reservations about the union initially and teased Philip as the Hun . 44 In later life however she told the biographer Tim Heald that Philip was an English gentleman . 45 Wedding portrait of Philip and Elizabeth Though Philip appeared always to have regarded himself as an Anglican 46 and he had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England and throughout his Royal Navy days he was baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church . The Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher wanted to regularise Philips position by officially receiving him into the Church of England 47 which he did in October 1947. 48 The day before the wedding the King bestowed the style of Royal Highness on Philip and on the morning of the wedding 20 November 1947 he was made the Duke of Edinburgh Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London. 49 Consequently being already a Knight of the Garter between 19 and 20 November 1947 he bore the unusual style Lieutenant His Royal Highness Sir Philip Mountbatten and is so described in the letters patent of 20 November 1947. 49 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world. 50 In post-war Britain it was unacceptable for any of Philips German relations including his three surviving sisters to be invited to the wedding. After their marriage Philip and Elizabeth took residence at Clarence House . Their first two children were born before Elizabeths accession in 1952: Prince Charles in November 1948 and Princess Anne in August 1950. The couples marriage was the longest of any British monarch lasting over 73 years until Philip died in 2021. 51 52 Concerned by her fathers poor health Elizabeth insisted that Philip give up smoking which he did cold turkey on their wedding day. 53 Philip was introduced to the House of Lords on 21 July 1948 54 immediately before his uncle Louis Mountbatten who had been made Earl Mountbatten of Burma . 55 Philip ostensibly never spoke in the House of Lords . 56 He his sons and other royals ceased to be members of the House of Lords following the House of Lords Act 1999 although Philips former brother-in-law Lord Snowdon remained in the House. 57 Early duties With Elizabeth on their 1951 tour of Canada meeting Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent right After his honeymoon at the Mountbatten family home Broadlands Philip returned to the navy at first in a desk job at the Admiralty and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College Greenwich . 58 From 1949 he was stationed in Malta residing at Villa Guardamangia after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet. 59 He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1950 and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie . 60 61 Philip was promoted to commander on 30 June 1952 62 though his active naval career had ended in July 1951. 63 64 With the King in ill health Elizabeth and Philip were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951 after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada. At the end of January 1952 the couple set out on a tour of the Commonwealth . They were in Kenya when Elizabeths father died on 6 February 1952 and she became queen. Philip broke the news to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom. 65 In December 1952 Philip was initiated into Freemasonry by the Worshipful Master of Navy Lodge No 2612 honouring a commitment he had made to George VI who had made it clear that he expected Philip to maintain the tradition of royal patronage of Freemasonry. However according to one journalist writing in 1983 Philips mother-in-law and his uncle Lord Mountbatten had unfavourable views of Freemasonry; after his initiation Philip took no further part in the organisation. Although as the consort of the Queen he might in time have been made Grand Master of British Freemasonry Elizabeths cousin Prince Edward Duke of Kent assumed that role in 1967. Philips son Charles apparently never joined Freemasonry. 66 Consort of the Queen Royal house Coronation portrait of Elizabeth II with Philip June 1953 by Cecil Beaton Elizabeths accession to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philips last name upon marriage. Lord Mountbatten advocated the name House of Mountbatten . Philip suggested House of Edinburgh after his ducal title. 67 When Elizabeths grandmother Queen Mary heard of this she informed Winston Churchill who later advised Elizabeth to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor . Philip privately complained I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children. 68 In February 1960 the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that Mountbatten-Windsor would be the surname of the couples male-line descendants who are not styled as Royal Highness or titled as prince or princess. 69 While it seems Elizabeth had absolutely set her heart on such a change and had it in mind for some time it occurred only 11 days before the birth of their third child Prince Andrew and only after three months of protracted correspondence between English constitutional expert Edward Iwi who averred that without such a change the royal child would be born with the Badge of Bastardy and Harold Macmillan who had attempted to refute Iwis arguments. 70 Elizabeth and Philips fourth child Prince Edward was born in March 1964. 71 Six months after she acceded to the throne Elizabeth announced that Philip was to have place pre-eminence and precedence next to her on all occasions and in all meetings except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament . 72 She also intervened to ensure that Philip would serve as regent for their son Charles in the event of her unexpected death. 73 Parliament passed a bill to that effect in 1953. 74 Contrary to rumours over the years Elizabeth and Philip were said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage despite the challenges of Elizabeths reign. 75 76 Elizabeth referred to Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her constant strength and guide . 76 Philip received a Parliamentary annuity of 359 000 since 1990 fn 3 to meet official expenses in carrying out public duties. The annuity was unaffected by the reform of royal finances under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 . 77 78 Any part of the allowance that was not used to meet official expenditure was liable for tax. In practice the entire allowance was used to fund his official duties. 79 Supporting the Queen With Elizabeth in New Zealand 1954 As consort Philip supported his wife in her duties as sovereign accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries state dinners and tours abroad. As chairman of the Coronation Commission he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony. 80 Philip was not himself crowned in the coronation service but knelt before Elizabeth with her hands enclosing his and swore to be her liege man of life and limb . 81 For six months spanning 1953 and 1954 they toured the Commonwealth; as was customary during previous tours the children remained in Britain. 82 In the early 1950s Philips sister-in-law Princess Margaret considered marrying a divorced older man Peter Townsend . The press accused Philip of being hostile to the match to which he replied: I havent done anything. 83 Eventually Margaret and Townsend parted. 82 In 1960 Margaret married Antony Armstrong-Jones who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; Margaret did not remarry. 84 In 1956 Philip and Kurt Hahn founded The Duke of Edinburghs Award to give young people a sense of responsibility to themselves and their communities . In the same year he also established the Commonwealth Study Conferences . From 1956 to 1957 he travelled around the world aboard the newly commissioned HMY Britannia during which he opened the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne and visited the Antarctic becoming the first royal to cross the Antarctic Circle . 85 Elizabeth and the children remained in Britain. On the return leg of the journey Philips private secretary Mike Parker was sued for divorce by his wife. As with Townsend the press still portrayed divorce as a scandal and eventually Parker resigned. He later said that Philip was very supportive and the Queen was wonderful throughout. She regarded divorce as a sadness not a hanging offence. 86 In a public show of support Elizabeth created Parker a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order . 87 With Elizabeth in Ottawa 1957 Further press reports claimed that the royal couple were drifting apart which enraged Philip and dismayed Elizabeth who issued a strongly worded denial. 88 She granted him the style and title of a Prince of the United Kingdom by Letters Patent on 22 February 1957; it was gazetted that Philip was to be known as His Royal Highness The Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh . 89 Philip was appointed to the Queens Privy Council for Canada on 14 October 1957 taking his Oath of Allegiance before the Queen in person at her Canadian residence Rideau Hall . 90 Remarks he made two years later to the Canadian Medical Association on the subject of youth and sport were taken as a suggestion that Canadian children were out of shape. This was at first considered tactless but Philip was later admired for his encouragement of physical fitness . 91 While in Canada in 1969 he spoke about his views on republicanism : It is a complete misconception to imagine that the monarchy exists in the interests of the monarch. It doesnt. It exists in the interests of the people. If at any time any nation decides that the system is unacceptable then it is up to them to change it. 92 In 1960 Philip attended the National Eisteddfod of Wales wearing a long green robe where he was initiated as an Honorary Ovate by the Archdruid of Wales Edgar Phillips through his bardic name Philip Meirionnydd to reflect his title of Earl of Merioneth. 93 In 1961 he became the first member of the royal family to be interviewed on television after he appeared on Panorama to answer questions by Richard Dimbleby about the Commonwealth Technical Training Week an initiative of which he was patron . 94 In 1969 he made a similar appearance on Meet the Press during a tour of North America. 95 Charities and patronages Visiting Salford University 1967 Philip was patron of some 800 organisations particularly focused on the environment industry sport and education. His first solo engagement as Duke of Edinburgh was in March 1948 presenting prizes at the boxing finals of the London Federation of Boys Clubs at the Royal Albert Hall . 96 He was president of the National Playing Fields Association now known as Fields in Trust for 64 years from 1947 until his grandson Prince William took over the role in 2013. 97 He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1951 . 98 99 In 1952 he became patron of The Industrial Society since renamed The Work Foundation . 100 In the same year and after his father-in-laws death he took over the role of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park overseeing its protection and maintenance. 101 From 1955 to 1957 Philip was president of The Football Association and also served two terms as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club with his tenures starting in 1949 and 1974 respectively. 102 103 In the same decade he became the first patron of Lords Taverners a youth cricket and disability sports charity for which he organised fundraising events. 104 Between 1959 and 1965 Philip was the president of BAFTA . 105 He helped found the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1963 and the World Wildlife Fund in 1961 and served as the latters UK president from 1961 to 1982 international president from 1981 and president emeritus from 1996. 85 106 He was also president of the Zoological Society of London for two decades and was appointed an honorary fellow in 1977. 107 108 Despite his involvement in initiatives for conserving nature he was also criticised for practices such as fox hunting and shooting of game birds 106 and the killing of a tiger in India in 1961. 109 He was president of the International Equestrian Federation from 1964 to 1986. 110 In 1980 he became world champion in four-in-hand driving with the British national team. 111 He served as chancellor of the universities of Cambridge Edinburgh Salford and Wales . 112 In 1965 at the suggestion of Harold Wilson Philip became chair to a scheme set up for awarding industrial innovations which later became known as The Queens Awards for Enterprise . 113 In the same year Philip became president of the Council of Engineering Institutions and in that capacity he assisted with the inception of the Fellowship of Engineering later the Royal Academy of Engineering of which he later became the senior fellow. 114 He also commissioned the Prince Philip Designers Prize and the Prince Philip Medal to recognise designers and engineers with exceptional contributions. 114 115 In 1970 he was involved with the founding of The Maritime Trust for restoring and preserving historic British ships. 116 In 2017 the British Heart Foundation thanked Philip for being its patron for 55 years during which time in addition to organising fundraisers he supported the creation of nine BHF-funded centres of excellence . 117 He was an honorary fellow of St Edmunds College Cambridge . 118 Charles and Diana At the beginning of 1981 Philip wrote to his son Charles counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to Lady Diana Spencer or break off their courtship. 119 Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so proposing to Diana in February. 120 They married five months later. By 1992 the marriage had broken down. Elizabeth and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana trying to effect a reconciliation but without success. 121 Philip wrote to Diana expressing his disappointment at Charless and her extra-marital affairs and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the others point of view. 122 She found the letters hard to take but appreciated that he acted with good intent. 123 Charles and Diana separated in 1992 124 and divorced in 1996. 125 A year after the divorce Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. At the time Philip was on holiday at Balmoral with the extended royal family. In their grief Dianas sons Princes William and Harry wanted to attend church so Elizabeth and Philip took them that morning. 126 For five days the royal couple shielded their grandsons from the ensuing press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private. 126 The royal familys seclusion caused public dismay 126 but the public mood changed after a live broadcast made by Elizabeth on 5 September. 127 Uncertain as to whether they should walk behind their mothers coffin during the funeral procession William and Harry hesitated. 127 Philip told William: If you dont walk I think youll regret it later. If I walk will you walk with me? 127 On the day of the funeral Philip William Harry Charles and Dianas brother Earl Spencer walked through London behind her gun carriage. 127 Over the next few years Mohamed Al-Fayed whose son Dodi Fayed was also killed in the crash claimed that Philip had ordered the death of Diana and that the accident was staged. The inquest into Dianas death concluded in 2008 that there was no evidence of a conspiracy . 128 Longevity With Elizabeth during a visit to Titanic Belfast June 2012 In April 2009 Philip became the longest-serving British royal consort surpassing Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz wife of George III . 129 He became the oldest-ever male British royal in February 2013 and the third-longest-lived member of the British royal family following Princess Alice Duchess of Gloucester and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 2019. 130 Personally he was not enthused about living an extremely long life remarking in a 2000 interview when he was 79 that he could not imagine anything worse and had no desire whatsoever to become a centenarian saying bits of me are falling off already . 131 At the official opening of the Fifth Assembly of the Senedd in Cardiff 2016.

An eyewitness who helped him out of his car said there was a little bit of blood . 159 The driver and a passenger of the other car were injured and taken to hospital. 160 Philip attended hospital the next morning as a precaution. 161 He apologised 162 and three weeks later voluntarily surrendered his driving licence . 163 164 In February the Crown Prosecution Service announced that prosecuting Philip would not be in the public interest . 165 Philip was still allowed to drive around private estates and was seen behind the wheel in the grounds of Windsor Castle in April 2019. 166 In December 2019 Philip stayed at King Edward VIIs Hospital and received treatment for a pre-existing condition in a visit described by Buckingham Palace as a precautionary measure . 167 He had not been seen in public since attending Lady Gabriella Windsor s wedding in May 2019. 168 A photo of the royal couple as they isolated at Windsor Castle during the COVID-19 pandemic was released ahead of his 99th birthday in June 2020. 169 In July 2020 he stepped down as Colonel-in-Chief of The Rifles a position he had held since 2007. He was succeeded by his daughter-in-law Camilla Duchess of Cornwall . 170 In January 2021 Philip and Elizabeth were vaccinated against COVID-19 by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. 171 In February 2021 Philip was admitted to King Edward VIIs Hospital as a precautionary measure after feeling unwell; 172 he was visited by Prince Charles. 173 Buckingham Palace confirmed that Philip was responding to treatment for an infection. 174 175 In March Philip was transferred by ambulance to St Bartholomews Hospital to continue treatment for an infection and to undergo testing and observation relating to a pre-existing heart condition . 176 He underwent a successful procedure for his heart condition 177 and was transferred back to King Edward VIIs Hospital. 178 He was discharged a week later and returned to Windsor Castle. 179 Death Further information: Death and funeral of Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh Buckingham Palace on 9 April 2021; the Union Flag is flown at half-mast as crowds gather. Philip died of old age 180 fn 4 on the morning of 9 April 2021 at Windsor Castle at the age of 99. He was the longest-serving royal consort in world history. 182 Elizabeth who was reportedly at her husbands bedside when he died 183 described his death as having left a huge void in her life . 184 The palace said Philip died peacefully 185 which was confirmed by his daughter-in-law Sophie Countess of Wessex who told the press it was so gentle. It was just like somebody took him by the hand and off he went. 186 His death led to the commencement of Operation Forth Bridge the plan for publicly announcing his death and organising his funeral. 185 187 The usual public ceremonial could not take place because of the regulations for the COVID-19 pandemic which restricted the number of mourners to thirty; it was later reported in the press that Elizabeth had rejected a government offer to relax the rules. 188 The funeral took place on 17 April 2021 at St Georges Chapel Windsor Castle and Philip was temporarily interred alongside 25 other coffins including that of George III in the Royal Vault inside St Georges. 189 190 Representatives of countries around the world sent condolences to the royal family upon his death. 191 As with other senior members of the royal family Philips last will and testament will be sealed for at least 90 years according to a High Court ruling which deemed it necessary to protect the Queens dignity and standing . 192 This led to speculation that the will might contain material harmful to the reputation of the royal family. 193 The order was made by the President of the Family Division after a private hearing in July 2021 who said that he had neither seen the will nor been informed of any of its contents. In January 2022 The Guardian challenged the judges decision to exclude the press from that hearing arguing that the judge had erred by failing to consider any lesser interference with open justice than a private hearing and the newspaper was granted leave to appeal . 194 195 In July 2022 the Court of Appeal dismissed the newspapers arguments stating that the press could not have been informed of the hearing without risking the media storm that was feared . 196 The court added that a perceived lack of transparency might be a matter of legitimate public debate but the Non-Contentious Probate Rules allow wills and their values to be concealed from the public gaze in some cases . 196 A service of thanksgiving for Philips life took place at Westminster Abbey on 29 March 2022 with Elizabeth foreign royalty and politicians in attendance. 197 Elizabeth died on 8 September 2022 and the royal couples bodies were interred in the King George VI Memorial Chapel at St Georges on the evening of 19 September after her state funeral . 198 Legacy Interests At the World Championship Coach-and-fours 1982 Philip played polo until 1971 when he started to compete in carriage driving a sport which he helped to expand; the sports early rule book was drafted under his supervision. 199 He was also a keen yachtsman and struck up a friendship in 1949 with boat designer and sailing enthusiast Uffa Fox in Cowes . 200 Philips first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952 and by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5 150 pilot hours. 201 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953 helicopter wings with the Royal Navy in 1956 and his private pilots licence in 1959. 116 After 44 years as a pilot he retired in August 1997 with 5 986 hours spent in 59 different aircraft. 116 In April 2014 it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philips 1962 two-month flying tour of South America. Filmed sitting alongside him at the aircrafts controls was his co-pilot Captain Peter Middleton the grandfather of Philips granddaughter-in-law Catherine . 202 In 1959 Philip flew solo in a Druine Turbulent becoming the first and as of April 2021 update the only member of the royal family to have flown a single-seat aircraft. 203 Her Majesty the Queen at Breakfast painted by Philip in 1957. His biographer Robert Lacey described the painting as a tender portrayal impressionistic in style with brushstrokes that are charmingly soft and fuzzy . 204 Philip painted with oils and collected artworks including contemporary cartoons which hang at Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle. Hugh Casson described Philips own artwork as exactly what youd expect ... totally direct no hanging about. Strong colours vigorous brushstrokes. 205 He was patron of the Royal Society of Arts from 1952 until 2011. 206 He was fascinated by cartoons about the monarchy and the royal family and was a patron of The Cartoon Museum . 207 Personality and image Philip typically walked a few steps behind Elizabeth in public. Philips down-to-earth manner was attested to by a White House butler who recalled that on a visit in 1976 Philip engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation and poured them drinks. 208 fn 5 As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking 210 Philip was noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny or as gaffes: awkward politically incorrect or even offensive but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. 211 212 213 214 215 In an address to the General Dental Council in 1960 he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: Dontopedalogy is the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it a science which I have practised for a good many years. 216 Later in life he suggested his comments may have contributed to the perception that he was a cantankerous old sod . 217 In a private conversation with British students from Xian s Northwest University during a state visit to China in 1986 Philip joked: If you stay here much longer youll go slit-eyed. 218 The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK an official explained were often told in jest not to stay away too long lest they go round-eyed . 219 His comment did not affect Sino-British relations but it shaped his reputation. 220 Philip also made comments on the eating habits of Cantonese people stating: If it has four legs and is not a chair has wings and is not an airplane or swims and is not a submarine the Cantonese will eat it. 221 In Australia he asked an Indigenous Australian entrepreneur: Do you still throw spears at each other? 222 In 2011 historian David Starkey described Philip as a kind of HRH Victor Meldrew . 223 For example in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying: No wonder you are deaf listening to this row. 224 Later Philip wrote: The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages so its hardly likely that I would do any such thing. 225 When he and Elizabeth met Stephen Menary an army cadet blinded by a Real IRA bomb and Elizabeth enquired how much sight he retained Philip quipped: Not a lot judging by the tie hes wearing. Menary later said: I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didnt take any offence. 226 Philips comparison of prostitutes and wives was also perceived as offensive after he reportedly stated: I dont think a prostitute is more moral than a wife but they are doing the same thing. 221 Centenary To mark the centenary of Philips birth in June 2021 the Royal Collection Trust held an exhibition at Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse . Titled Prince Philip: A Celebration it showcased around 150 personal items related to him including his wedding card wedding menu midshipmans logbook from 1940 to 1941 Chair of Estate and the coronation robes and coronet that he wore for his wifes coronation in 1953 . 227 228 George Alexis Weymouth s portrait of Philip in the ruins of Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992 formed part of a focus on Philips involvement with the subsequent restoration. 228 The Royal Horticultural Society also marked Philips centenary by breeding a new rose in his honour christened The Duke of Edinburgh Rose created by British rose breeder Harkness Roses . Elizabeth as patron of the society was given the deep pink commemorative rose in honour of her husband and she remarked that It looks lovely . A Duke of Edinburgh Rose has since been planted in the mixed rose border of Windsor Castles East Terrace Garden. Philip played a major role in the gardens design. 229 230 In September 2021 the Royal National Lifeboat Institution honoured Philip by naming their new state-of-the-art lifeboat Duke of Edinburgh . The tribute was initially planned to mark his 100th birthday. 231 In the same month a documentary initially planned for his centenary was broadcast on BBC One under the title Prince Philip: The Royal Family Remembers with contributions from his children their spouses and seven of his grandchildren. 232 Portrayals Philip has been portrayed by several actors including Stewart Granger The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana 1982 Christopher Lee Charles Diana: A Royal Love Story 1982 David Threlfall The Queens Sister 2005 James Cromwell The Queen 2006 and Finn Elliot Matt Smith Tobias Menzies and Jonathan Pryce The Crown 2016 onwards. 233 234 He also appears as a fictional character in Nevil Shute s novel In the Wet 1952 Paul Gallico s novel Mrs. Arris Goes to Moscow 1974 Tom Clancy s novel Patriot Games 1987 and Sue Townsend s novel The Queen and I 1992. 235 Books Philip authored: Selected Speeches 194855 1957; revised paperback edition published by Nabu Press 2011 ISBN 978-1-245-67133-0 Selected Speeches 195659 1960 Birds from Britannia 1962; published in the United States as Seabirds from Southern Waters ISBN 978-1-163-69929-4 Wildlife Crisis with James Fisher 1970 ISBN 978-0-402-12511-2 The Environmental Revolution: Speeches on Conservation 19621977 1978 ISBN 978-0-8464-1453-7 Competition Carriage Driving 1982; published in France 1984; second edition 1984; revised edition 1994 ISBN 978-0-85131-594-2 A Question of Balance 1982 ISBN 978-0-85955-087-1 Men Machines and Sacred Cows 1984 ISBN 978-0-241-11174-1 A Windsor Correspondence with Michael Mann 1984 ISBN 978-0-85955-108-3 Down to Earth: Collected Writings and Speeches on Man and the Natural World 196187 1988; paperback edition 1989; Japanese edition 1992 ISBN 978-0-8289-0711-8 Survival or Extinction: A Christian Attitude to the Environment with Michael Mann 1989 ISBN 978-0-85955-158-8 Driving and Judging Dressage 1996 ISBN 978-0-85131-666-6 30 Years On and Off the Box Seat 2004 ISBN 978-0-85131-898-1 Forewords to: Royal Australian Navy 19111961 Jubilee Souvenir issued by authority of the Department of the Navy Canberra 1961 The Concise British Flora in Colour by William Keble Martin Ebury Press Michael Joseph 1965 Birds of Town and Village by William Donald Campbell and Basil Ede 1965 Kurt Hahn by Hermann Rohrs and Hilary Tunstall-Behrens 1970 The Doomsday Book of Animals by David Day 1981 Saving the Animals: The World Wildlife Fund Book of Conservation by Bernard Stonehouse 1981 The Art of Driving by Max Pape 1982 ISBN 978-0-85131-339-9 Yachting and the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club by Graeme Norman 1988 ISBN 978-0-86777-067-4 National Maritime Museum Guide to Maritime Britain by Keith Wheatley 2000 The Royal Yacht Britannia: The Official History by Richard Johnstone-Bryden Conway Maritime Press 2003 ISBN 978-0-85177-937-9 1953: The Crowning Year of Sport by Jonathan Rice 2003 British Flags and Emblems by Graham Bartram Tuckwell Press 2004 ISBN 978-1-86232-297-4 Chariots of War by Robert Hobson Ulric Publication 2004 ISBN 978-0-9541997-1-5 RMS Queen Mary 2 Manual: An Insight into the Design Construction and Operation of the Worlds Largest Ocean Liner by Stephen Payne Haynes Publishing 2014 The Triumph of a Great Tradition: The Story of Cunards 175 Years by Eric Flounders and Michael Gallagher Lily Publications 2014 ISBN 978-1-906608-85-9 Titles styles honours and arms Further information: List of titles and honours of Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh Philips cypher Philip held many titles throughout his life.
