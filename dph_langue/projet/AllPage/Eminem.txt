He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as among the greatest rappers of all time. 3 His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most successful songs on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 include The Real Slim Shady Without Me Lose Yourself Not Afraid Love the Way You Lie The Monster Godzilla and Houdini . 4 After the release of his debut album Infinite 1996 and the extended play Slim Shady EP 1997 Eminem signed with Dr. Dre s Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP . His next two releases The Marshall Mathers LP 2000 and The Eminem Show 2002 were worldwide successes and nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002 . After the release of his next album Encore 2004 Eminem went on hiatus largely due to a prescription drug addiction. 5 He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse 2009 and Recovery 2010 the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010.

Eminem played a dramatized version of himself in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile . Lose Yourself a song from its soundtrack topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeksthe most for a solo rap songand won the Academy Award for Best Original Song making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. 6 He also co-founded Shady Records which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12 50 Cent and Obie Trice and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel Shade 45 . Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart 7 and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. 8 The Marshall Mathers LP The Eminem Show Curtain Call: The Hits 2005 Lose Yourself Love the Way You Lie and Not Afraid have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA. 9 He has won numerous awards including 15 Grammy Awards eight American Music Awards 17 Billboard Music Awards a Primetime Emmy Award and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award . Billboard named him the Artist of the Decade 20002009 and Rolling Stone named him one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time . In 2022 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . 10 Early life Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17 1972 in St. Joseph Missouri the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae Debbie nee Nelson. 11 12 : 17 His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. 13 : 1 Eminems parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old and Eminem was raised only by his mother Debbie in poverty. 11 He wrote letters to his father but Debbie said that they all came back marked return to sender . 14 His mother later had a son named Nathan Nate Kane Samara. 12 After living in several towns in Missouri and Michigan Eminem and his mother settled in 8 Mile Road in Detroit. By age of twelve Eminem and his mother shuttled between states rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members moved several times and lived in St. Joseph Savannah Missouri Kansas City Warren Michigan and Roseville Michigan 15 before settling in Detroit . 16 For much of his youth Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class primarily black Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths. 14 Eminem frequently fought with his mother whom a social worker described as having a very suspicious almost paranoid personality . 13 : 3 When he was a child a bully named DAngelo Bailey severely injured Eminems head in an assault 17 an incident which Eminem later recounted with comic exaggeration on the song Brain Damage . Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County Michigan judge who said the schools were immune from lawsuits. 13 : 2 Eminem was interested in storytelling aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip hop . 18 He heard his first rap song Reckless featuring Ice-T on the Breakin soundtrack a gift from Debbies half-brother Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkingharn committed suicide in 1991 Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral. 14 19 At age 14 Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names Manix and MM the latter evolving into Eminem . 19 13 : 4 Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. 20 : 119 On Saturdays they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road considered ground zero for the Detroit rap scene. 14 Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences. 19 21 22 When he wrote verses he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and underneath worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes. 23 In 1987 Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne Kim Scott to stay at their home. Several years later Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. 13 : 4 After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades 24 17-year-old Eminem dropped out of Lincoln High School . Although interested in English Eminem never explored literature preferring comic books and he disliked math and social studies. 23 Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills one of which was at Little Caesars Pizza in Warren. 25 He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway often after taking most of his paycheck . When she left to play bingo he would blast the stereo and write songs. 14 Music career 19881997: early career Infinite and family struggles In 1988 he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group New Jacks and made a self-titled demo tape with DJ Butter Fingers. 1 26 27 In 1989 they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper Proof and other childhood friends. 28 They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof. 19 Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled Do-Da-Dippity by Champtown . Later in 1996 Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen D12 who released The Underground E.P. in 1997 and their first album Devils Night in 2001. 14 He was also affiliated with Newarks rap collective Outsidaz collaborating with them on different projects. 29 In 1995 Eminem was signed to Jeff and Mark Bass F.B.T. Productions and in 1995-1996 recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label. 20 : 15 The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996. 30 One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter Hailie Jade Scott Mathers on little money. During this period Eminems rhyming style primarily inspired by rappers Nas Esham and AZ lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known. 20 : 16 Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite and the feedback Eminem did receive Why dont you go into rock and roll? led him to craft angrier moodier tracks. 14 At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood where their house was robbed several times. 14 Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilberts Lodge a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores . 20 : 14 His former boss described him as becoming a model employee as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailies birth. 13 : 4 He was fired shortly before Christmas and later said It was like five days before Christmas which is Hailies birthday. I had like forty dollars to get her something. 14 After the release of Infinite his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt. 19 By March 1997 he was fired from Gilberts Lodge for the last time and lived in his mothers mobile home with Kim and Hailie. 13 : 4 19971999: introduction of Slim Shady The Slim Shady LP and rise to success Eminem and Proof performing at Juice Jam in Munich Germany in 1999 Eminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady a sadistic violent alter ego . The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs rape and murder. 13 : 4 In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP the Slim Shady EP which was released that winter by Web Entertainment . 14 The EP with frequent references to drug use sexual acts mental instability and violence also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct self-deprecating response to criticism. 19 Hip hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its Unsigned Hype column in March 1998. 20 : 81 After he was fired from his job and evicted from his home Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics a nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second losing to Project Blowed MC Otherwize. 31 An Interscope Records intern named Dean Geistlinger was in attendance and asked Eminem for a copy of the Slim Shady EP which was then sent to company CEO Jimmy Iovine . 32 Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip hop group N.W.A . Dre recalled In my entire career in the music industry I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this I said Find him. Now. Dre would later state on the fourth and last episode of The Defiant Ones I was like: what the fuck!? and who the fuck is that? expressing his shock towards Matherss rapping talent. Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper Dre was confident in his decision: I dont give a fuck if youre purple; if you can kick it Im working with you. 14 Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager and was nervous about working with him on an album: I didnt want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... Im just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars let alone Dr. Dre . 20 : 24 He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions. 33 On March 9 1998 Eminem got signed to Aftermath and Interscope. 34 Eminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the years most popular albums certified triple platinum by the end of the year 35 he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage . 36 37 The albums popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in 97 Bonnie Clyde Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wifes body and in Guilty Conscience which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. Guilty Conscience marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs Forgot About Dre and Whats the Difference while also providing uncredited vocals on The Watcher from Dr. Dres album 2001 Bitch Please II from The Marshall Mathers LP Say What You Say from The Eminem Show EncoreCurtains Down from Encore and Old Times Sake and Crack a Bottle from Relapse and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminems Aftermath albums. 38 The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA. 39 19992003: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show Eminem at the ARCO Arena for the Up in Smoke Tour in June 2000 After Eminem released The Slim Shady LP he started his own record label Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem looked for an avenue to release D12 and his manager Paul Rosenberg was keen to start a label which led to the two teaming up to form Shady. 40 Its AR Marc Labelle has defined the record label as a boutique label but with all the outlets of a major and Interscope backing up our every move. 41 Recorded from 1999 to 2000 42 The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1.76 million copies in its first week breaking U.S. records held by Snoop Dogg s Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album. 43 44 The first single from the album The Real Slim Shady was a success despite controversies about Eminems insults and dubious claims about celebrities for example that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Carson Daly and Fred Durst . 20 : 60 In his second single The Way I Am he reveals the pressure from his record company to top My Name Is . Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for My Name Is they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in The Way I Am appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem. 45 In the third single Stan which samples Dido s Thank You Eminem tries to deal with his new fame assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend mirroring 97 Bonnie Clyde from The Slim Shady LP . 21 The music magazine Q called Stan the third-greatest rap song ever 46 and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey. 47 The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. 48 In July 2000 Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source . 20 : 81 The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 21 million copies worldwide. 49 In 2000 Eminem also appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre Snoop Dogg Xzibit and Ice Cube 50 and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit 20 : 70 headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach Ludacris and Xzibit . Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001 51 with the Gay Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation GLAAD an organization which considered Eminems lyrics homophobic condemning Johns decision to perform with Eminem. 52 Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade best-of list: It was the hug heard round the world. Eminem under fire for homophobic lyrics shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of Stan that would have been memorable in any context. 53 On February 21 the day of the awards ceremony GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center the ceremonys venue. 54 Eminem was also the only guest artist to appear on fellow rapper Jay-Z s critically acclaimed album The Blueprint producing and rapping on the song Renegade . 55 The Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week. 35 The albums single Without Me denigrates boy bands Limp Bizkit Dick and Lynne Cheney Moby and others. The Eminem Show certified Diamond by the RIAA examines the effects of Eminems rise to fame his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip hop community addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP . 56 L. Brent Bozell III who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics noted The Eminem Show s extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem Eminef for the prevalence of the word motherfucker on the album. 57 The Eminem Show sold 27 million copies worldwide 49 and was the bestselling album of 2002. 58 20032007: production work Encore and musical hiatus Eminem on the Anger Management Tour in 2003 In 2003 Eminem a lifelong fan of Tupac 59 provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack. 60 He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupacs Loyal to the Game album. 60 On December 8 2003 the United States Secret Service said that it was looking into allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. 61 The cause for concern was the lyrics of We As Americans Fuck money I dont rap for dead presidents Id rather see the president dead Its never been said but I set precedents which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore . 62 Encore released in 2004 was another success but not as successful as his previous albums. Its sales were partially driven by the first single Just Lose It which contained slurs directed toward Michael Jackson . On October 12 2004 a week after the release of Just Lose It Jackson phoned Steve Harvey s radio show The Steve Harvey Morning Show to report his displeasure with its video which parodies Jacksons child molestation trial plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jacksons hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial. In the song Eminem says Thats not a stab at Michael Thats just a metaphor Im just psycho. Many of Jacksons friends and supporters spoke out against the video including Stevie Wonder who described it as kicking a man while hes down and bullshit 63 and Steve Harvey who said Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back . 63 The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period. 64 Weird Al Yankovic who parodied the Eminem song Lose Yourself on Couch Potato for his 2003 album Poodle Hat told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jacksons protest: Last year Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my Lose Yourself parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me. 65 Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source through CEO Raymond Benzino Scott called for the video to be pulled the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson. 66 In 2007 Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom giving him the rights to songs by Eminem Shakira Beck and others. 67 Despite its lead singles humorous theme Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song Mosh which criticized President George W. Bush as This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president with lyrics including Fuck Bush. 68 On October 25 2004 a week before the 2004 U.S. Presidential election Eminem released the video for Mosh on the Internet. 69 In it Eminem gathers an army including rapper Lloyd Banks of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House . When they break in it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with VOTE Tuesday November 2. After Bushs reelection the videos ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president. 70 Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel Shade 45 on Sirius radio 71 which was described by his manager as essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people arent playing. 72 Eminem began his first U.S. concert tour in three years in the summer of 2005 with the Anger Management 3 Tour featuring 50 Cent G-Unit Lil Jon D12 Obie Trice and the Alchemist but in August Eminem canceled the European leg of the tour later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a dependency on sleep medication . 73 Meanwhile industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering retirement while rumors circulated that a double album titled The Funeral would be released. 74 In July the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. 75 A greatest hits album Curtain Call: The Hits was released on December 6 2005 by Aftermath Entertainment 76 and sold nearly 441 000 copies in the U.S. in its first week marking Eminems fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200 77 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA . 78 However Eminem suggested that month on WKQI s Mojo in the Morning show that he would be taking a break as an artist: Im at a point in my life right now where I feel like I dont know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it Curtain Call because this could be the final thing. We dont know. 79 Proofs death in 2006 was one of the factors that caused Eminem to fall into depression during his five-year hiatus. 80 In April 2006 Proof who was Eminems childhood friend was murdered. 81 Eight months later Eminem released a compilation album titled Eminem Presents: The Re-Up that featured Proof and other Shady Records artists. citation needed 20072009: comeback and Relapse In September 2007 Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent saying that he was in limbo and debating about when or if he would release another album: Im always workingIm always in the studio. It feels good right now the energy of the label. For a while I didnt want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. Im coming out of those personal things and it feels good. 82 Eminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008 saying: Right now Im kinda just concentrating on my own stuff for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get cause I just start knowing stuff. 83 Interscope confirmed that a new album 84 would be released in spring 2009. 85 In December 2008 Eminem provided more details about the album entitled Relapse : Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on Relapse. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... lets just leave it at that. 86 According to a March 5 2009 press release Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse the first was released on May 19; its first single and music video We Made You had been released on April 7. 87 Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminems previous albums and received mixed reviews it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. 88 On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans his first full performance of the year. 89 Eminems act included several songs from Relapse many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19 he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks including Forever and Taking My Ball . Eminem described the CD: I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers including Just Blaze and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2 but I still want the other stuff to be heard. 90 20092011: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion Eminem performing with D12 in May 2009 On April 14 2010 Eminem tweeted : There is no Relapse 2 . Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting Recovery with a link to his website. He said: I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse and I think it deserves its own title. 91 Recorded from 2009 to 2010 Recovery was released on June 18. 91 In the U.S. Recovery sold 741 000 copies during its first week topping the Billboard 200 chart. 92 93 Eminems sixth consecutive U.S. number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total. 94 Billboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010 making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums. 95 Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history. 96 Its first single Not Afraid was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4. 97 Not Afraid was followed by Love the Way You Lie which debuted at number two before rising to the top. 98 Although Love the Way You Lie was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom it did not reach number one the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969. 99 Despite criticism of its inconsistency Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21 2010 update the album had U.S. sales of three million copies. 100 Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010 joining 2002s bestseller The Eminem Show to give Eminem two worldwide year-end number-one albums. 101 With Recovery Eminem broke the record for the most successive U.S. number-one albums by a solo artist. 102 He appeared at the 2010 BET Awards 103 performing Not Afraid and Airplanes Part II with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole . Later that year he performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York City at concerts called The Home Home Tour .

For other uses see Slim Shady disambiguation . Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter including Slim Shady and Ken Kaniff among others. Slim Shady is the controversial and rebellious alter ego of Eminem introduced in his 1997 extended play The Slim Shady EP . Conceived during a period of personal and professional struggle Slim Shady allowed Eminem to express his darker more aggressive thoughts through exaggerated and often violent lyrical content. This persona embodies the chaotic satirical side of Eminems music pushing boundaries with provocative sometimes offensive themes which blend fiction and reality. The use of Slim Shady is shown in The Slim Shady LP The Marshall Mathers LP The Eminem Show Encore Relapse The Marshall Mathers LP 2 Kamikaze Music to Be Murdered By and The Death of Slim Shady Coup de Grace . 253 254 Slim Shadys influence on Eminems career is significant. His shock-value content helped skyrocket the rapper to fame but also attracted criticism and legal challenges particularly due to songs like 97 Bonnie and Clyde and Kim where he addresses deeply personal and often disturbing subjects such as family conflicts and imagined violence. Despite the controversy the Slim Shady character is credited with much of Eminems early success but over time the persona also contributed to the rappers personal struggles including substance abuse . 255 256 Another character is Ken Kaniff a gay man who pokes fun at Eminems songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on The Slim Shady LP where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the albums release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on The Marshall Mathers LP and later albums except Encore and Recovery . Aristotle angry with Eminems use of his character released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him. 257 Collaborations and productions See also: Eminem production discography Although Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre 50 Cent D12 Obie Trice and Yelawolf he has also worked with Redman Kid Rock DMX Lil Wayne Missy Elliott Jay Z Drake Rihanna Nas Kanye West Nicki Minaj Xzibit Method Man Jadakiss Fat Joe Sticky Fingaz T.I. and Young Jeezy .

In 2022 Game would later release a ten-minute diss track towards Eminem titled The Black Slim Shady . 266 Eminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics rather than writing to beats. 41 One exception was Stan which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King . 41 After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2 . He said about producing his own music Sometimes I may get something in my head like an idea or the mood of something that I would want and Im not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They dont know whats in my head. I think maybe it helps a little bit with diversity the sound of it but also I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch. 267 In 1998 when his beef with rapper Cage was still happening New York rapper Necro who had previously produced three songs for Cage met Eminem and gave him a CD with the beat to what eventually became the beat for the song Black Helicopters by rap group Non-Phixion . Despite Eminem never using it Necro still said positive things about Eminem and would appear on Shade45 years later. 268 Comparisons with other artists As a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists Eminem has been compared much to his chagrin 269 to Elvis Presley 270 and has lyrically been compared to Bob Dylan . 271 Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem and Roth devoted a song on his album As I Em to him which Eminem took offense to. 272 273 The accomplished trumpeter Nicholas Payton has called Eminem the Bix Beiderbecke of hip hop . 274 Legacy Eminem is one of the best-selling artists in music history easily the biggest crossover success ever seen in rap. To call him hip-hops Elvis is correct to a degree but its largely inaccurate. Certainly he was the first white rapper since the Beastie Boys to garner both sales and critical respect but his impact has exceeded this confining distinction. Stephen Thomas Erlewine 275 Credited for popularizing hip hop to a Middle American audience Eminems unprecedented global commercial success and acclaimed works for a white rapper is widely recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music . 276 Rising from rags to riches Eminems anger-fueled music represented widespread angst and the reality of American underclass . 277 He has been greatly influential for artists of various genres. Stephen Hill the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET Black Entertainment Television said in 2002: Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average had to be the best to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way he is the best lyricist alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel there is no one better at their game than Eminem. 278 In 2002 the BBC said that the perception of Eminem as a modern-day William Shakespeare was comparable to the reception of American singer Bob Dylan : Not since Bob Dylans heyday in the mid-1960s has an artists output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. U.S. critics point to Eminems vivid portraits of disenfranchised livesusing the stark direct language of the streetas an accurate reflection of social injustice. In addition the BBC highlighted that Where parents once recoiled in horror to his music there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young angry white underclass. 279 Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage misguided rebellion adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation. 280 Writing for Spin in 2002 rock critic Alan Light compared Eminem to the Beatles John Lennon : Eminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons ... Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generations John Lennon ... Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon of course was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars but still few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem. 281 Regarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the Stan duet at the 2001 Grammy Awards English singer Elton John said When Eminem made his entrance I got goose bumps the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix Mick Jagger James Brown and Aretha Franklin . Eminem was that good. I just thought Fuck this man is amazing. There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first timeonly the greats. 282 John further praised Eminem saying Eminem is a true poet of his time someone well be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist hes one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what Bob Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger vulnerability and humor come out. 282 Eminem graffiti in Shanghai China Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his transgressive music American entertainer Madonna had said I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect ... Hes stirring things up hes provoking a discussion hes making peoples blood boil. Hes reflecting whats going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do. 283 American musician Stevie Wonder also said Rap to me is a modern blues a statement of how and where people are at ... I think art is a reflection of our society and people dont like to confront the realities in society ... But until we really confront the truth we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about itand thank God.
