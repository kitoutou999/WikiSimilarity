Apart from 1922 to 1924 he was a member of Parliament MP from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies . Ideologically an adherent to economic liberalism and imperialism he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924. Of mixed English and American parentage Churchill was born in Oxfordshire into the wealthy aristocratic Spencer family . He joined the British Army in 1895 and saw action in British India the Mahdist War and the Second Boer War gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. Elected a Conservative MP in 1900 he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In H. H. Asquith s Liberal government Churchill was president of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary championing prison reform and workers social security. As First Lord of the Admiralty during the First World War he oversaw the Gallipoli campaign but after it proved a disaster was demoted to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster . He resigned in November 1915 and joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front for six months. In 1917 he returned to government under David Lloyd George and served successively as Minister of Munitions Secretary of State for War Secretary of State for Air and Secretary of State for the Colonies overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and British foreign policy in the Middle East . After two years out of Parliament he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin s Conservative government returning sterling in 1925 to the gold standard depressing the UK economy. Out of government during his so-called wilderness years in the 1930s Churchill took the lead in calling for rearmament to counter the threat of militarism in Nazi Germany . At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In May 1940 he became prime minister succeeding Neville Chamberlain . Churchill formed a national government and oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers resulting in victory in 1945 . After the Conservatives defeat in the 1945 general election he became Leader of the Opposition . Amid the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union he publicly warned of an iron curtain of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Between his terms he wrote several books recounting his experience during the war. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953. He lost the 1950 election but was returned to office in 1951 . His second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs especially Anglo-American relations and preservation of what remained of the British Empire with India now no longer part of it. Domestically his government completed the development of a nuclear weapon. In declining health Churchill resigned in 1955 remaining an MP until 1964 . Upon his death in 1965 he was given a state funeral . One of the 20th centurys most significant figures Churchill remains popular in the UK and the rest of the Anglosphere . He is generally viewed as a victorious wartime leader who defended liberal democracy against the spread of fascism and as a liberal reformer who spurred the creation of the modern welfare state. However recent scholarship has been more critical of Churchill especially with regards to his views on race and his unwavering commitment to British imperialism. 2 3 Nonetheless historians and the British public often rank Churchill as one of the greatest prime ministers in British history . Early life Main article: Early life of Winston Churchill Childhood and schooling: 18741895 Jennie Spencer Churchill with her two sons Jack left and Winston right in 1889 Churchill was born on 30 November 1874 at his familys ancestral home Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. 4 On his fathers side he was a member of the aristocracy as a descendant of John Churchill 1st Duke of Marlborough . 5 His father Lord Randolph Churchill representing the Conservative Party had been elected Member of Parliament MP for Woodstock in 1874. 6 His mother Jennie was a daughter of Leonard Jerome an American businessman. 7 In 1876 Churchills paternal grandfather John Spencer-Churchill 7th Duke of Marlborough was appointed Viceroy of Ireland . Randolph became his private secretary and the family relocated to Dublin . 8 Winstons brother Jack was born there in 1880. 9 For much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged 10 and the brothers cared for by their nanny Elizabeth Everest . 11 When she died in 1895 Churchill wrote she had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived . 12 Churchill began boarding at St Georges in Ascot Berkshire aged 7 was not academic and his behaviour was poor. 13 In 1884 he transferred to Brunswick School in Hove where his academic performance improved. 14 In April 1888 aged 13 he passed the entrance exam for Harrow School . 15 His father wanted him to prepare for a military career so his last three years at Harrow were in the army form. 16 After two unsuccessful attempts to gain admittance to the Royal Military College Sandhurst he succeeded. 17 He was accepted as a cadet in the cavalry starting in September 1893. 18 His father died in January 1895. 19 Cuba India and Sudan: 18951899 Churchill in the military dress uniform of the 4th Queens Own Hussars at Aldershot in 1895 20 In February 1895 Churchill was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queens Own Hussars regiment of the British Army based at Aldershot . 21 Eager to witness military action he used his mothers influence to get posted to a war zone. 22 In the autumn he and friend Reggie Barnes went to observe the Cuban War of Independence and became involved in skirmishes after joining Spanish troops attempting to suppress independence fighters. 23 Churchill sent reports to the Daily Graphic in London. 24 He proceeded to New York and wrote to his mother about what an extraordinary people the Americans are! 25 With the Hussars he went to Bombay in October 1896. 26 Based in Bangalore he was in India for 19 months visiting Calcutta and joining expeditions to Hyderabad and the North West Frontier . 27 In India Churchill began a self-education project 28 reading widely including Plato Edward Gibbon Charles Darwin and Thomas Babington Macaulay . 29 The books were sent by his mother with whom he shared frequent correspondence. To learn about politics he asked her to send him copies of The Annual Register the political almanac. 30 In an 1898 letter he referred to his beliefs saying: I do not accept the Christian or any other form of religious belief . 31 Churchill had been christened in the Church of England 32 but underwent a virulently anti-Christian phase in his youth 33 and as an adult was an agnostic. 34 In another letter to a cousin he referred to religion as a delicious narcotic and expressed a preference for Protestantism over Roman Catholicism because he felt it a step nearer Reason . 35 Interested in parliamentary affairs 36 he declared himself a Liberal in all but name adding he could never endorse the Liberal Party s support for Irish home rule . 37 Instead he allied himself to the Tory democracy wing of the Conservatives and on a visit home gave his first speech for the partys Primrose League at Claverton Down . 38 Mixing reformist and conservative perspectives he supported the promotion of secular non-denominational education while opposing womens suffrage . 39 Churchill volunteered to join Bindon Blood s Malakand Field Force in its campaign against Mohmand rebels in the Swat Valley of north-west India. Blood accepted on condition he was assigned as a journalist the beginning of Churchills writing career. 40 He returned to Bangalore in October 1897 and wrote his first book The Story of the Malakand Field Force which received positive reviews. 41 He wrote his only work of fiction Savrola a Ruritanian romance . 42 To keep occupied Churchill embraced writing as what Roy Jenkins calls his whole habit especially through his career when he was out of office. Writing was his safeguard against recurring depression which he referred to as his black dog . 43 Using London contacts Churchill got attached to General Herbert Kitchener s campaign in the Sudan as a 21st Lancers subaltern while working as a journalist for The Morning Post . 44 After fighting in the Battle of Omdurman in September 1898 the 21st Lancers were stood down. 45 In October Churchill returned to England and began writing The River War about the campaign published in 1899. He decided to leave the army 46 as he was critical of Kitcheners actions particularly the unmerciful treatment of enemy wounded and his desecration of Muhammad Ahmad s tomb. 47 On 2 December 1898 Churchill embarked for India to settle his military business and complete his resignation. He spent much time playing polo the only ball sport in which he was ever interested. Having left the Hussars he sailed from Bombay on 20 March 1899 determined to launch a career in politics. 48 Politics and South Africa: 18991901 Churchill in 1900 around the time of his first election to Parliament 49 Churchill spoke at Conservative meetings 50 and was selected as one of the partys two candidates for the June 1899 Oldham by-election . 51 While campaigning Churchill referred to himself as a Conservative and a Tory Democrat . 52 Although the seats had been held by the Conservatives the result was a narrow Liberal victory. 53 Anticipating the outbreak of the Second Boer War between Britain and the Boer republics Churchill sailed to South Africa as a journalist for the Morning Post . 54 55 In October he travelled to the conflict zone near Ladysmith then besieged by Boer troops before heading for Colenso . 56 At the Battle of Chieveley his train was derailed by Boer artillery shelling he was captured as a prisoner of war POW and interned in a POW camp in Pretoria . 57 In December Churchill escaped and evaded his captors by stowing aboard freight trains and hiding in a mine. He made it to safety in Portuguese East Africa . 58 His escape attracted much publicity. 59 In January 1900 he briefly rejoined the army as a lieutenant in the South African Light Horse regiment joining Redvers Buller s fight to relieve the Siege of Ladysmith and take Pretoria. 60 He was among the first British troops into both places. He and cousin Charles Spencer-Churchill 9th Duke of Marlborough demanded and received the surrender of 52 Boer prison camp guards. 61 Throughout the war he publicly chastised anti-Boer prejudices calling for them to be treated with generosity and tolerance 62 and afterwards urged the British to be magnanimous in victory. 63 In July having resigned his lieutenancy he returned to Britain. His Morning Post despatches had been published as London to Ladysmith via Pretoria and sold well. 64 Churchill rented a flat in Londons Mayfair using it as his base for six years. He stood again as a Conservative candidate at Oldham in the October 1900 general election securing a narrow victory to become a Member of Parliament aged 25. 65 In the same month he published Ian Hamiltons March a book about his South African experiences 66 67 which became the focus of a lecture tour in November through Britain America and Canada. Members of Parliament were unpaid and the tour was a financial necessity. In America Churchill met Mark Twain President McKinley and Vice President Theodore Roosevelt who he did not get on with. 68 In spring 1901 he gave lectures in Paris Madrid and Gibraltar. 69 Conservative MP: 19011904 Churchill in 1904 when he crossed the floor In February 1901 Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons where his maiden speech gained widespread coverage. 70 He associated with a group of Conservatives known as the Hughligans 71 but was critical of the Conservative government on various issues especially increases in army funding. He believed additional military expenditure should go to the navy. 72 This upset the Conservative front bench but was supported by Liberals with whom he increasingly socialised particularly Liberal Imperialists like H. H. Asquith . 73 Churchill later wrote that he drifted steadily to the left . 74 He privately considered the gradual creation by an evolutionary process of a Democratic or Progressive wing to the Conservative Party 75 or alternately a Central Party to unite the Conservatives and Liberals. 76 By 1903 there was division between Churchill and the Conservatives largely because he opposed their promotion of protectionism . As a free trader he helped found the Free Food League . 24 Churchill sensed that the animosity of party members would prevent him gaining a Cabinet position under a Conservative government. The Liberal Party was attracting growing support and so his defection in 1904 may have been influenced by ambition. 77 He increasingly voted with the Liberals. 78 For example he opposed an increase in military expenditure 79 supported a Liberal bill to restore legal rights to trade unions 78 and opposed the introduction of import tariffs. 80 Arthur Balfour s government announced protectionist legislation in October 1903. 81 Two months later incensed by Churchills criticism of the government the Oldham Conservative Association informed him it would not support his candidature at the next election. 82 In May 1904 Churchill opposed the governments proposed Aliens Bill designed to curb Jewish immigration. 83 He stated that the bill would appeal to insular prejudice against foreigners to racial prejudice against Jews and to labour prejudice against competition and expressed himself in favour of the old tolerant and generous practice of free entry and asylum to which this country has so long adhered and from which it has so greatly gained . 83 On 31 May 1904 he crossed the floor to sit as a member of the Liberal Party. 84 Liberal MP: 19041908 Main article: Winston Churchills Liberal Party years 19041924 Churchill and German Kaiser Wilhelm II during a military manoeuvre near Breslau Silesia in 1906 As a Liberal Churchill attacked government policy and gained a reputation as a radical under the influences of John Morley and David Lloyd George . 24 In December 1905 Balfour resigned as prime minister and King Edward VII invited the Liberal leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman to replace him. 85 Hoping to secure a working majority Campbell-Bannerman called a general election in January 1906 which the Liberals won in a massive landslide. 86 Churchill won the Manchester North West seat 87 and his biography of his father was published; 88 he received advance payment of 8 000. 89 It was generally well received. 90 The first biography of Churchill himself written by the Liberal MacCallum Scott was published. 91 In the new government Churchill became Under-Secretary of State for the Colonial Office a junior ministerial position he had requested. 92 He worked beneath the Secretary of State for the Colonies Victor Bruce 9th Earl of Elgin 93 and took Edward Marsh as his secretary; Marsh remained his secretary for 25 years. 94 Churchills first task was helping to draft a constitution for the Transvaal ; 95 and he helped oversee the formation of a government in the Orange River Colony . 96 In dealing with southern Africa he sought to ensure equality between the British and Boers. 97 He announced a gradual phasing out of the use of Chinese indentured labourers in South Africa; he and the government decided a sudden ban would cause too much upset and might damage the colonys economy. 98 He expressed concerns about the relations between European settlers and the black African population; after the Zulu launched their Bambatha Rebellion in Natal Churchill complained about the disgusting butchery of the natives by Europeans. 99 Asquith government: 19081915 Main article: Winston Churchills Liberal Party years 19041924 President of the Board of Trade: 19081910 Churchill and his fiancee Clementine Hozier shortly before their marriage in 1908 With Campbell-Bannerman terminally ill Asquith became prime minister in April 1908. He appointed Churchill as President of the Board of Trade . 100 Aged 33 Churchill was the youngest Cabinet member since 1866. 101 Newly appointed Cabinet ministers were legally obliged to seek re-election at a by-election. On 24 April Churchill lost the Manchester North West by-election to the Conservative candidate by 429 votes. 102 On 9 May the Liberals stood him in the safe seat of Dundee where he won comfortably . 103 Churchill proposed marriage to Clementine Hozier ; they were married on 12 September 1908 at St Margarets Westminster and honeymooned in Baveno Venice and Veveri Castle in Moravia . 104 105 They lived at 33 Eccleston Square London and their first daughter Diana was born in 1909. 106 107 The success of their marriage was important to Churchills career as Clementines unbroken affection provided him with a secure and happy background. 24 One of Churchills first tasks as a minister was to arbitrate in an industrial dispute among ship-workers and employers on the River Tyne . 108 He afterwards established a Standing Court of Arbitration to deal with industrial disputes 109 establishing a reputation as a conciliator. 110 He worked with Lloyd George to champion social reform . 111 He promoted what he called a network of State intervention and regulation akin to that in Germany. 112 Continuing Lloyd Georges work 24 Churchill introduced the Mines Eight Hours Bill which prohibited miners from working more than an eight-hour day . 113 In 1909 he introduced the Trade Boards Bill creating Trade Boards which could prosecute exploitative employers. Passing with a large majority it established the principle of a minimum wage and the right to have meal breaks. 114 In May 1909 he proposed the Labour Exchanges Bill to establish over 200 Labour Exchanges through which the unemployed would be assisted in finding employment. 115 He promoted the idea of an unemployment insurance scheme which would be part-funded by the state. 116 To ensure funding for their reforms Lloyd George and Churchill denounced Reginald McKenna s policy of naval expansion 117 refusing to believe war with Germany was inevitable. 118 As Chancellor Lloyd George presented his Peoples Budget on 29 April 1909 calling it a war budget to eliminate poverty. With Churchill as his closest ally 24 Lloyd George proposed unprecedented taxes on the rich to fund Liberal welfare programmes. 119 The budget was vetoed by the Conservative peers who dominated the House of Lords . 120 His social reforms under threat Churchill became president of the Budget League 24 and warned that upper-class obstruction could anger working-class Britons and lead to class war. 121 The government called the January 1910 general election which resulted in a Liberal victory; Churchill retained his seat at Dundee. 122 He proposed abolition of the House of Lords in a cabinet memo suggesting it be succeeded by a unicameral system or smaller second chamber that lacked an in-built advantage for the Conservatives. 123 In April the Lords relented and the Peoples Budget passed. 124 Churchill continued to campaign against the House of Lords and assisted passage of the Parliament Act 1911 which reduced and restricted its powers. 24 Home Secretary: 19101911 In February 1910 Churchill was promoted to Home Secretary giving him control over the police and prison services; 125 he implemented a prison reform programme. 126 Measures included a distinction between criminal and political prisoners with rules for the latter being relaxed. 127 There were educational innovations like the establishment of libraries 128 and a requirement to stage entertainments four times a year. 129 The rules on solitary confinement were relaxed 130 and Churchill proposed abolition of automatic imprisonment of those who failed to pay fines. 131 Imprisonment of people aged between 16 and 21 was abolished except for the most serious offences. 132 Churchill reduced commuted 21 of the 43 death capital sentences passed while he was Home Secretary. 133 A major domestic issue was womens suffrage. Churchill supported giving women the vote but would only back a bill to that effect if it had majority support from the male electorate. 134 His proposed solution was a referendum but this found no favour with Asquith and womens suffrage remained unresolved until 1918. 135 Many suffragettes believed Churchill was a committed opponent 136 and targeted his meetings for protest. 135 In November 1910 the suffragist Hugh Franklin attacked Churchill with a whip; Franklin was imprisoned for six weeks. 136 Churchill second left photographed at the Siege of Sidney Street In November 1910 Churchill had to deal with the Tonypandy riots in which coal miners in the Rhondda Valley violently protested against working conditions. 137 The Chief Constable of Glamorgan requested troops to help police quell the rioting. Churchill learning that the troops were already travelling allowed them to go as far as Swindon and Cardiff but blocked their deployment; he was concerned their use lead to bloodshed. Instead he sent 270 London police who were not equipped with firearms to assist. 137 As the riots continued he offered the protesters an interview with the governments chief industrial arbitrator which they accepted. 138 Privately Churchill regarded the mine owners and striking miners as very unreasonable . 136 The Times and other media outlets accused him of being soft on the rioters; 139 in contrast many in the Labour Party which was linked to the trade unions regarded him as too heavy-handed. 140 Churchill incurred the long-term suspicion of the labour movement . 24 Asquith called a general election in December 1910 and the Liberals were re-elected with Churchill secure in Dundee. 141 In January 1911 Churchill became involved in the Siege of Sidney Street ; 3 Latvian burglars had killed police officers and hidden in a house in the East End of London surrounded by police. 142 Churchill stood with the police though he did not direct their operation. 143 After the house caught fire he told the fire brigade not to proceed into the house because of the threat posed by the armed men. Afterwards two of the burglars were found dead. 143 Although he faced criticism for his decision he stated he thought it better to let the house burn down rather than spend good British lives in rescuing those ferocious rascals . 144 In March 1911 Churchill introduced the second reading of the Coal Mines Bill ; when implemented it imposed stricter safety standards. 145 He formulated the Shops Bill to improve working conditions of shop workers; it faced opposition from shop owners and only passed in a much emasculated form. 146 In April Lloyd George introduced the first health and unemployment insurance legislation the National Insurance Act 1911 which Churchill had been instrumental in drafting. 146 In May Clementine gave birth to their 2nd child Randolph named after his father. 147 In response to escalating civil strife in 1911 Churchill sent troops into Liverpool to quell protesting dockers and rallied against a national railway strike . 148 During the Agadir Crisis of April 1911 when there was a threat of war between France and Germany Churchill suggested an alliance with France and Russia to safeguard the independence of Belgium Denmark and the Netherlands to counter possible German expansionism. 149 The Crisis had a profound effect on Churchill and he altered his views about the need for naval expansion. 150 First Lord of the Admiralty As First Lord of the Admiralty Churchills London residency was Admiralty House. In October 1911 Asquith appointed Churchill First Lord of the Admiralty 151 and he took up official residence at Admiralty House . 152 He created a naval war staff 24 and over the next two and a half years focused on naval preparation visiting naval stations and dockyards seeking to improve morale and scrutinising German naval developments. 153 After Germany passed its 1912 Naval Law to increase warship production Churchill vowed that for every new German battleship Britain would build two. 154 He invited Germany to engage in a mutual de-escalation but this was refused. 155 Churchill pushed for higher pay and greater recreational facilities for naval staff 156 more submarines 157 and a renewed focus on the Royal Naval Air Service encouraging them to experiment with how aircraft could be used for military purposes. 158 He coined the term seaplane and ordered 100 to be constructed. 159 Some Liberals objected to his level of naval expenditure; in December 1913 he threatened to resign if his proposal for 4 new battleships in 191415 was rejected. 160 In June 1914 he convinced the House of Commons to authorise the government purchase of a 51 share in the profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to secure oil access for the navy. 161 The central issue in Britain was Irish Home Rule and in 1912 Asquiths government introduced the Home Rule Bill . 162 Churchill supported it and urged Ulster Unionists to accept it as he opposed the Partition of Ireland . 163 Concerning the possibility of partition Churchill stated: Whatever Ulsters right may be she cannot stand in the way of the whole of the rest of Ireland. Half a province cannot impose a permanent veto on the nation. Half a province cannot obstruct forever the reconciliation between the British and Irish democracies . 164 Speaking in the House of Commons on 16 February 1922 Churchill said: What Irishmen all over the world most desire is not hostility against this country but the unity of their own . 164 Following a Cabinet decision he boosted the naval presence in Ireland to deal with any Unionist uprising. 165 Seeking a compromise Churchill suggested Ireland remain part of a federal UK but this angered Liberals and Irish nationalists. 166 As First Lord Churchill was tasked with overseeing Britains naval effort when the First World War began in August 1914. 167 The navy transported 120 000 troops to France and began a blockade of Germanys North Sea ports. Churchill sent submarines to the Baltic Sea to assist the Russian Navy and sent the Marine Brigade to Ostend forcing a reallocation of German troops. 168 In September Churchill assumed full responsibility for Britains aerial defence. 169 On 7 October Clementine gave birth to their 3rd child Sarah . 170 In October Churchill visited Antwerp to observe Belgian defences against the besieging Germans and promised reinforcements. 171 Soon afterwards Antwerp fell to the Germans and Churchill was criticised in the press. 172 He maintained that his actions had prolonged resistance and enabled the Allies to secure Calais and Dunkirk . 173 In November Asquith called a War Council including Churchill. 174 Churchill set the development of the tank on the right track and financed its creation with Admiralty funds. 175 Churchill was interested in the Middle Eastern theatre and wanted to relieve pressure on the Russians in the Caucasus by staging attacks against Turkey in the Dardanelles . He hoped that the British could even seize Constantinople . 176 Approval was given and in March 1915 an Anglo-French task force attempted a naval bombardment of Turkish defences. In April the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force including the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ANZAC began its assault at Gallipoli . 177 Both campaigns failed and Churchill was held by many MPs particularly Conservatives to be responsible. 178 In May Asquith agreed under parliamentary pressure to form an all-party coalition government but the Conservatives condition of entry was that Churchill must be removed from the Admiralty. 179 Churchill pleaded his case with Asquith and Conservative leader Bonar Law but had to accept demotion. 180 Military service 19151916 Main article: Winston Churchills Liberal Party years 19041924 Churchill commanding the 6th Battalion the Royal Scots Fusiliers 1916. On 25 November 1915 Churchill resigned from the government although he remained an MP. Asquith rejected his request to be appointed Governor-General of British East Africa . 181 Churchill decided to return to active service with the Army and was attached to the 2nd Grenadier Guards on the Western Front . 182 In January 1916 he was temporarily promoted to lieutenant-colonel and given command of the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers . 183 184 The battalion was moved to a sector of the Belgian Front near Ploegsteert . 185 For three months they faced continual shelling though no German offensive. 186 Churchill narrowly escaped death when during a visit by his cousin Marlborough a large piece of shrapnel fell between them. 187 In May the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers were merged into the 15th Division. Churchill did not request a new command instead securing permission to leave active service. 188 His temporary promotion ended on 16 May 1916 when he returned to the rank of major . 189 Back in the House of Commons Churchill spoke out on war issues calling for conscription to be extended to the Irish greater recognition of soldiers bravery and for the introduction of steel helmets. 190 It was in November 1916 that he penned The greater application of mechanical power to the prosecution of an offensive on land but it fell on deaf ears. 191 He was frustrated at being out of office but was repeatedly blamed for the Gallipoli disaster by the pro-Conservative press. 192 Churchill argued his case before the Dardanelles Commission whose report placed no blame on him personally for the campaigns failure. 193 Lloyd George government: 19161922 Main article: Winston Churchills Liberal Party years 19041924 Minister of Munitions: 19171919 In October 1916 Asquith resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Lloyd George who in May 1917 sent Churchill to inspect the French war effort. 194 In July Churchill was appointed Minister of Munitions . 195 He negotiated an end to a strike in munitions factories along the Clyde and increased munitions production. 196 In his October 1917 letter to his Cabinet colleagues he penned the plan of attack for the next year that would bring final victory to the Allies. 191 He ended a second strike in June 1918 by threatening to conscript strikers into the army. 197 In the House of Commons Churchill voted in support of the Representation of the People Act 1918 which gave some women the right to vote. 198 In November 1918 four days after the Armistice Churchills fourth child Marigold was born. 199 Secretary of State for War and Air: 19191921 Churchill meets female workers at Georgetowns filling works near Glasgow in October 1918. Lloyd George called a general election for 14 December 1918. 200 During the campaign Churchill called for nationalisation of the railways a control on monopolies tax reform and the creation of a League of Nations to prevent wars. 201 He was returned as MP for Dundee and though the Conservatives won a majority Lloyd George was retained as prime minister. 201 In January 1919 Lloyd George moved Churchill to the War Office as both Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air . 202 Churchill was responsible for demobilising the army 203 though he convinced Lloyd George to keep a million men conscripted for the British Army of the Rhine . 204 Churchill was one of the few government figures who opposed harsh measures against Germany 199 and he cautioned against demobilising the German Army warning they might be needed as a bulwark against Soviet Russia . 205 He was outspoken against Vladimir Lenin s Communist Party government in Russia. 206 He initially supported using British troops to assist the anti-Communist White forces in the Russian Civil War 207 but soon recognised the peoples desire to bring them home. 208 After the Soviets won the civil war Churchill proposed a cordon sanitaire around the country. 209 In the Irish War of Independence he supported the use of the paramilitary Black and Tans to combat Irish revolutionaries. 210 After British troops in Iraq clashed with Kurdish rebels Churchill authorised two squadrons to the area proposing they be equipped with poison gas to be used to inflict punishment upon recalcitrant natives without inflicting grave injury upon them although this was never implemented. 211 He saw the occupation of Iraq as a drain on Britain and proposed unsuccessfully that the government should hand control back to Turkey. 212 Secretary of State for the Colonies: 19211922 Churchill as Secretary of State for the Colonies during his visit to Mandatory Palestine Tel Aviv 1921 Churchills main home was Chartwell in Kent. Churchill became Secretary of State for the Colonies in February 1921. 213 The following month the first exhibit of his paintings took place in Paris with Churchill exhibiting under a pseudonym. 213 In May his mother died followed in August by his daughter Marigold from sepsis . 214 Churchill was haunted by Marigolds death for the rest of his life. 215 Churchill was involved in negotiations with Sinn Fein leaders and helped draft the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 216 He was responsible for reducing the cost of occupying the Middle East 213 and was involved in the installations of Faisal I of Iraq and Abdullah I of Jordan . 217 Churchill travelled to Mandatory Palestine where as a supporter of Zionism he refused an Arab Palestinian petition to prohibit Jewish migration. 218 He did allow temporary restrictions following the Jaffa riots . 219 In September 1922 the Chanak Crisis erupted as Turkish forces threatened to occupy the Dardanelles neutral zone which was policed by the British army based in Chanak . Churchill and Lloyd George favoured military resistance to any Turkish advance but the majority Conservatives in the coalition government opposed it. A political debacle ensued which resulted in the Conservative withdrawal from the government precipitating the November 1922 general election . 24 Also in September Churchills fifth and last child Mary was born and in the same month he purchased Chartwell in Kent which became his family home. 220 In October 1922 he underwent an appendectomy . While he was in hospital Lloyd Georges coalition was dissolved. In the general election Churchill lost his Dundee seat 221 to Edwin Scrymgeour a prohibitionist candidate. Later he wrote that he was without an office without a seat without a party and without an appendix . 222 He was elevated as one of 50 members of the Order of the Companions of Honour as named in Lloyd Georges 1922 Dissolution Honours list. 223 Out of Parliament: 19221924 Main article: Winston Churchills Liberal Party years 19041924 Churchill with children Randolph and Diana in 1923 Churchill spent much of the next six months at the Villa Reve dOr near Cannes where he devoted himself to painting and writing his memoirs. 224 He wrote an autobiographical history of the war The World Crisis . The first volume was published in April 1923 and the rest over the next ten years. 221 After the 1923 general election was called seven Liberal associations asked Churchill to stand as their candidate and he selected Leicester West but did not win. 225 A Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald took power. Churchill had hoped they would be defeated by a Conservative-Liberal coalition. 226 He strongly opposed the MacDonald governments decision to loan money to Soviet Russia and feared the signing of an Anglo-Soviet Treaty. 227 In March 1924 alienated by Liberal support for Labour Churchill stood as an independent anti-socialist candidate in the Westminster Abbey by-election but was defeated. 228 In May he addressed a Conservative meeting in Liverpool and declared there was no longer a place for the Liberal Party in politics. He said that Liberals must back the Conservatives to stop Labour and ensure the successful defeat of socialism . 229 In July he agreed with Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin that he would be selected as a Conservative candidate in the next general election which was held on 29 October. Churchill stood at Epping but described himself as a Constitutionalist . 230 The Conservatives were victorious and Baldwin formed the new government. Although Churchill had no background in finance or economics Baldwin appointed him as Chancellor. 231 Chancellor of the Exchequer: 19241929 Main article: Chancellorship of Winston Churchill Becoming Chancellor on 6 November 1924 Churchill formally rejoined the Conservative Party. 232 As Chancellor he intended to pursue his free trade principles in the form of laissez-faire economics as under the Liberal social reforms. 232 In April 1925 he controversially albeit reluctantly restored the gold standard in his first budget at its 1914 parity against the advice of leading economists including John Maynard Keynes . 233 The return to gold is held to have caused deflation and resultant unemployment with a devastating impact on the coal industry. 234 Churchill presented five budgets in all to April 1929. Among his measures were reduction of the state pension age from 70 to 65; immediate provision of widows pensions ; reduction of military expenditure; income tax reductions and imposition of taxes on luxury items. 235 During the General Strike of 1926 Churchill edited the British Gazette the governments anti-strike propaganda newspaper. 236 After the strike ended he acted as an intermediary between striking miners and their employers. He called for the introduction of a legally binding minimum wage. 237 In a House of Commons speech in 1926 Churchill made his feelings on the issue of Irish unity clear. He stated that Ireland should be united within itself but also united to the British Empire. 238 In early 1927 Churchill visited Rome where he met Mussolini whom he praised for his stand against Leninism . 239 The Wilderness Years : 19291939 Main article: Winston Churchills Wilderness years 19291939 Marlborough and the India Question: 19291932 Churchill meeting with film star Charlie Chaplin in 1929 In the 1929 general election Churchill retained his Epping seat but the Conservatives were defeated and MacDonald formed his second Labour government. 240 Out of office Churchill was prone to depression his black dog but addressed this by writing. 241 He began work on Marlborough: His Life and Times a biography of his ancestor John Churchill 1st Duke of Marlborough. 242 243 He had developed a reputation for being a heavy drinker although Jenkins believes that was often exaggerated. 244 Hoping that the Labour government could be ousted he gained Baldwins approval to work towards establishing a Conservative-Liberal coalition although many Liberals were reluctant. 242 In October 1930 after his return from a trip to North America Churchill published his autobiography My Early Life which sold well and was translated into multiple languages. 245 In January 1931 Churchill resigned from the Conservative Shadow Cabinet because Baldwin supported the governments decision to grant Dominion Status to India. 246 Churchill believed that enhanced home rule status would hasten calls for full independence. 247 He was particularly opposed to Mohandas Gandhi whom he considered a seditious Middle Temple lawyer now posing as a fakir . 248 His views enraged Labour and Liberal opinion though he was supported by many grassroot Conservatives. 249 The October 1931 general election was a landslide victory for the Conservatives. 250 Churchill nearly doubled his majority in Epping but was not given a ministerial position. 251 The Commons debated Dominion Status for India on 3 December and Churchill insisted on dividing the House but this backfired as only 43 MPs supported him. 252 He embarked on a lecture tour of North America hoping to recoup financial losses sustained in the Wall Street Crash . 250 252 On 13 December he was crossing Fifth Avenue in New York when he was knocked down by a car suffering a head wound from which he developed neuritis . 253 To further his convalescence he and Clementine took ship to Nassau for three weeks but Churchill became depressed about his financial and political losses. 254 He returned to America in late January 1932 and completed most of his lectures before arriving home on 18 March. 254 Having worked on Marlborough for much of 1932 Churchill in August decided to visit his ancestors battlefields. 255 In Munich he met Ernst Hanfstaengl a friend of Hitler who was then rising in prominence. Hanfstaengl tried to arrange a meeting between Churchill and Hitler but Hitler was unenthusiastic: What on earth would I talk to him about? 256 Soon after visiting Blenheim Churchill was affected by paratyphoid fever and spent two weeks at a sanatorium in Salzburg . 257 He returned to Chartwell on 25 September still working on Marlborough . Two days later he collapsed after a recurrence of paratyphoid which caused an ulcer to haemorrhage. He was taken to a London nursing home and remained there until late October. 258 Warnings about Germany and the abdication crisis: 19331936 After Hitler came to power in January 1933 Churchill was quick to stand in opposition to such a regime and expressed alarm that the British government had reduced air force spending and warned that Germany would soon overtake Britain in air force production. 259 260 Armed with data provided clandestinely by senior civil servants Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram Churchill was able to speak with authority about what was happening in Germany especially the development of the Luftwaffe . 261 He spoke of his concerns in a radio broadcast in November 1934 262 having denounced the intolerance and militarism of Nazism in the House of Commons. 263 While Churchill regarded Mussolinis regime as a bulwark against the threat of communist revolution he opposed the Italian invasion of Ethiopia 264 despite describing the country as a primitive uncivilised nation. 265 He admired the exiled king of Spain Alfonso XIII and feared Communism was making inroads during the Spanish Civil War . He referred to Franco s army as the anti-red movement but later became critical of Franco as too close to Mussolini and Hitler. 266 267 Between October 1933 and September 1938 the four volumes of Marlborough: His Life and Times were published and sold well. 268 In December 1934 the India Bill entered Parliament and was passed in February 1935. Churchill and 83 other Conservative MPs voted against it. 269 In June 1935 MacDonald resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Baldwin. 264 Baldwin then led the Conservatives to victory in the 1935 general election ; Churchill retained his seat but was again left out of the government. 270 In January 1936 Edward VIII succeeded his father George V as monarch. His desire to marry an American divorcee Wallis Simpson caused the abdication crisis . 271 Churchill supported Edward and clashed with Baldwin on the issue. 272 Afterwards although Churchill immediately pledged loyalty to George VI he wrote that the abdication was premature and probably quite unnecessary . 273 Anti-appeasement: 19371939 Churchill and Neville Chamberlain the chief proponent of appeasement In May 1937 Baldwin resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Neville Chamberlain . At first Churchill welcomed Chamberlains appointment but in February 1938 matters came to a head after Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden resigned over Chamberlains appeasement of Mussolini 274 a policy which Chamberlain was extending towards Hitler. 275 In 1938 Churchill warned the government against appeasement and called for collective action to deter German aggression. 276 277 Following the Anschluss Churchill spoke in the House of Commons: A country like ours possessed of immense territory and wealth whose defence has been neglected cannot avoid war by dilating upon its horrors or even by a continuous display of pacific qualities or by ignoring the fate of the victims of aggression elsewhere. War will be avoided in present circumstances only by the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor. 278 He began calling for a mutual defence pact among European states threatened by German expansionism arguing this was the only way to halt Hitler. 279 In September Germany mobilised to invade the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. 280 Churchill visited Chamberlain and urged him to tell Germany that Britain would declare war if the Germans invaded Czechoslovak territory; Chamberlain was unwilling to do this. 281 On 30 September Chamberlain signed the Munich Agreement agreeing to allow German annexation of the Sudetenland. Speaking in the House of Commons on 5 October Churchill called the agreement a total and unmitigated defeat . 282 283 284 Following the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 Churchill and his supporters called for the foundation of a national coalition. His popularity increased as a result. 24 First Lord of the Admiralty: September 1939 to May 1940 Main article: Winston Churchill in the Second World War Phoney War and the Norwegian Campaign On 3 September 1939 the day Britain declared war on Germany Chamberlain reappointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and he joined Chamberlains war cabinet . 285 Churchill was a highest-profile minister during the so-called Phoney War . Churchill was ebullient after the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December 1939 and welcomed home the crews congratulating them on a brilliant sea fight . 286 On 16 February 1940 Churchill ordered Captain Philip Vian of the destroyer HMS Cossack to board the German supply ship Altmark in Norwegian waters freeing 299 British merchant seamen who had been captured by the Admiral Graf Spee . These actions and his speeches enhanced Churchills reputation. 286 He was concerned about German naval activity in the Baltic and wanted to send a naval force but this was soon changed to a plan codenamed Operation Wilfred to mine Norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from Narvik to Germany. 287 Due to disagreements Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940 the day before the German invasion of Norway . 288 Norway Debate and Chamberlains resignation Main article: Norway Debate Churchill with Lord Halifax in 1938 After the Allies failed to prevent the German occupation of Norway the Commons held a debate from 7 to 9 May on the governments conduct of the war. This became known as the Norway Debate one of the most significant events in parliamentary history. 289 On the second day the Labour opposition called for a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlains government. 290 Churchill was called upon to wind up the debate which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his prestige. 291 Although the government won the vote its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government. 292 Early on 10 May German forces invaded Belgium Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to their assault on France . 293 Since the division vote Chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition but Labour declared on the Friday they would not serve under his leadership although they would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Churchill and Lord Halifax the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been discussed at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain Halifax Churchill and David Margesson the government Chief Whip . 293 Halifax admitted he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords so Chamberlain advised the King to send for Churchill who became prime minister. 294 Churchill later wrote of a profound sense of relief as he now had authority over the whole scene. He believed his life so far had been a preparation for this hour and for this trial . 295 296 297 Prime Minister: 194045 Main article: Winston Churchill in the Second World War For a chronological guide see Timeline of Winston Churchills first premiership . Dunkirk to Pearl Harbor: May 1940 to December 1941 Churchill takes aim with a Sten sub-machine gun in June 1941. War ministry created Main article: Churchill war ministry In May Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives and most of the Labour Party. 298 Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October. By that time Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality. 299 He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet : Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal later Deputy Prime Minister Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labours Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio . In practice these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended most meetings. 300 301 The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed a key appointment being the leading trades unionist Ernest Bevin as Minister of Labour and National Service . 302 In response to criticisms Churchill created and assumed the position of Minister of Defence making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in history. 303 He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions especially on the Home Front. These included friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann who became the governments scientific advisor. 304 Resolve to fight on Main article: 1940 British war cabinet crisis At the end of May with the British Expeditionary Force in retreat to Dunkirk and the Fall of France imminent Halifax proposed the government should explore a peace settlement using the still-neutral Mussolini as an intermediary. There were high-level meetings from 26 to 28 May including with the French premier Paul Reynaud . 305 Churchills resolve was to fight on even if France capitulated but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. By gaining the support of his outer cabinet Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over. 306 Churchill succeeded as an orator despite being handicapped from childhood with a speech impediment. He had a lateral lisp and was unable to pronounce the letter s verbalising it with a slur. 307 He worked on his pronunciation by repeating phrases designed to cure his problem with the sibilant s . He was ultimately successful turning the impediment into an asset as when he called Hitler a Nar-zee rhymes with khazi ; emphasis on the z rather than a Nazi ts . 308 His first speech as prime minister delivered to the Commons on 13 May was the blood toil tears and sweat speech. 309 Churchill made it plain to the nation that a long road lay ahead and that victory was the final goal: 310 311 I would say to the House... that I have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. You ask what is our policy? I will say: it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask what is our aim? I can answer in one word: it is victory victory at all costs victory in spite of all terror victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival. Churchills use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution Jenkins says Churchills speeches were an inspiration for the nation and a catharsis for Churchill himself . 312 Operation Dynamo and the Battle of France The Dunkirk evacuation of 338 226 Allied servicemen ended on 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. The total was far in excess of expectations and gave rise to a popular view Dunkirk had been a miracle even a victory. 313 Churchill himself referred to a miracle of deliverance in his we shall fight on the beaches speech to the Commons that afternoon. The speech ended on a note of defiance with a clear appeal to the United States: 314 315 We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air. We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender and even if which I do not for a moment believe this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving then our Empire beyond the seas armed and guarded by the British Fleet would carry on the struggle until in Gods good time the New World with all its power and might steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old. Germany initiated Fall Rot in France the following day and Italy entered the war on the 10th. 316 The Wehrmacht occupied Paris on the 14th and completed their conquest of France on 25 June. 317 It was now inevitable that Hitler would attack and probably try to invade Great Britain. Faced with this Churchill addressed the Commons on 18 June with one of his most famous speeches ending with this peroration: 318 319 320 What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves that if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years men will still say: This was their finest hour . Churchill ordered the commencement of the Western Desert campaign on 11 June a response to the Italian declaration of war. This went well at first while Italy was the sole opposition and Operation Compass was a success. In early 1941 however Mussolini requested German support. Hitler sent the Afrika Korps to Tripoli under Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel who arrived not long after Churchill had halted Compass so he could reassign forces to Greece where the Balkans campaign was entering a critical phase. 321 In other initiatives through June and July 1940 Churchill ordered the formation of the Special Operations Executive SOE and Commandos . The SOE was ordered to promote and execute subversive activity in Nazi-occupied Europe while the Commandos were charged with raids on military targets there. Hugh Dalton the Minister of Economic Warfare took political responsibility for the SOE and recorded that Churchill told him: And now go and set Europe ablaze . 322 Battle of Britain and the Blitz Churchill walks through the ruins of Coventry Cathedral 1941 On 20 August 1940 at the height of the Battle of Britain Churchill addressed the Commons to outline the situation. In the middle of it he made a statement that created a famous nickname for the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle: 323 324 The gratitude of every home in our Island in our Empire and indeed throughout the world except in the abodes of the guilty goes out to the British airmen who undaunted by odds unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger are turning the tide of the World War by their prowess and by their devotion. Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. The Luftwaffe altered its strategy from 7 September 1940 and began the Blitz which was intensive through October and November. Churchills morale was high and told his private secretary John Colville in November he thought the threat of invasion was past. 325 He was confident Great Britain could hold its own given the increase in output but was realistic about its chances of winning the war without American intervention. 326 Lend-Lease In September 1940 the British and American governments concluded the destroyers-for-bases deal by which 50 American destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy in exchange for free US base rights in Bermuda the Caribbean and Newfoundland . An added advantage for Britain was that its military assets in those bases could be redeployed elsewhere. 327 Churchills good relations with President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped secure vital food oil and munitions via the North Atlantic shipping routes. 328 It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940 . Roosevelt set about implementing a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain without the need for monetary payment. He persuaded Congress that repayment for this costly service would take the form of defending the US. The policy was known as Lend-Lease and was formally enacted on 11 March 1941. 329 Operation Barbarossa Churchill and Roosevelt seated on the quarterdeck of HMS Prince of Wales for a Sunday service during the Atlantic Conference 10 August 1941 Hitler launched his invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Churchill had known since April from Enigma decrypts at Bletchley Park that the attack was imminent. He had tried to warn Joseph Stalin via the ambassador to Moscow Stafford Cripps but Stalin did not trust Churchill. The night before the attack already intending to address the nation Churchill alluded to his hitherto anti-communist views by saying to Colville: If Hitler invaded Hell I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil . 330 Atlantic Charter In August 1941 Churchill made his first transatlantic crossing of the war on board HMS Prince of Wales and met Roosevelt in Placentia Bay Newfoundland. On 14 August they issued the joint statement known as the Atlantic Charter . 331 This outlined the goals of both countries for the future of the world and is seen as the inspiration for the 1942 Declaration by United Nations itself the basis of the UN founded in 1945. 332 Pearl Harbor to D-Day: December 1941 to June 1944 Pearl Harbor and United States entry into the war In December 1941 the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their invasion of Malaya and on the 8th Churchill declared war on Japan. With the hope of using Irish ports for counter-submarine operations Churchill sent a telegram to Irish Prime Minister Eamon de Valera in which he obliquely offers Irish unity: Now is your chance. Now or never! A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish. No meeting took place and there is no record of a response. 333 Churchill went to Washington to meet Roosevelt for the Arcadia Conference . This was important for Europe first the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific taken by Roosevelt while Churchill was still in the mid-Atlantic. The Americans agreed with Churchill that Hitler was the main enemy and defeat of Germany was key to Allied success. 334 It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch the invasion of French North Africa . Originally planned for the spring 1942 it was launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was underway. 335 On 26 December Churchill addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress but that night suffered a heart attack diagnosed by his physician Sir Charles Wilson as a coronary deficiency needing several weeks bed rest. Churchill insisted he did not need bed rest and journeyed to Ottawa by train where he gave a speech to the Canadian Parliament that included the some chicken some neck line in which he recalled French predictions in 1940 that Britain alone would have her neck wrung like a chicken . 336 He arrived home mid-January having flown from Bermuda to Plymouth in the first transatlantic air crossing by a head of government to find there was a crisis of confidence in his government and him; 337 he decided to face a vote of confidence in the Commons which he won easily. 338 While he was away the Eighth Army having relieved the Siege of Tobruk had pursued Operation Crusader against Rommels forces in Libya successfully driving them back to a defensive position at El Agheila in Cyrenaica . On 21 January 1942 however Rommel launched a surprise counter-attack which drove the Allies back to Gazala . Elsewhere British success in the Battle of the Atlantic was compromised by the Kriegsmarine s introduction of its M4 4-rotor Enigma whose signals could not be deciphered by Bletchley Park for nearly a year. 339 At a press conference in Washington Churchill had to play down his increasing doubts about the security of Singapore given Japanese advances. 340 Fall of Singapore and loss of Burma Churchill already had grave concerns about the quality of British troops after the defeats in Norway France Greece and Crete . 341 Following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 he felt his misgivings were confirmed and said: this is the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British military history . 342 On 11 February the Kriegsmarine pulled off its audacious Channel Dash a massive blow to British naval prestige. The combined effect of these events was to sink Churchills morale to its lowest point of the war. 341 The Bengal Famine Meanwhile the Japanese had occupied most of Burma by the end of April 1942. Counter-offensives were hampered by the monsoon season and disordered conditions in Bengal and Bihar as well as a severe cyclone which devastated the region in October 1942. A combination of factors including the curtailment of essential rice imports from Burma poor administration wartime inflation and large-scale natural disasters such as flooding and crop disease led to the Bengal famine of 1943 343 in which an estimated 2.13.8 million people died. 344 From December 1942 food shortages had prompted senior officials to ask London for grain imports although the colonial authorities failed to recognise the seriousness of the famine and responded ineptly. 345 Churchills government was criticised for refusing to approve more imports a policy it ascribed to an acute shortage of shipping. 346 When the British realised the full extent of the famine in September 1943 Churchill ordered the transportation of 130 000 tons of grain and the cabinet agreed to send 200 000 tons by the end of the year. 347 348 During the last quarter of 1943 100 000 tons of rice and 176 000 tons of wheat were imported compared to averages of 55 000 and 54 000 tons respectively earlier in the year. 349 In October Churchill wrote to the Viceroy of India Lord Wavell charging him with the responsibility of ending the famine. 347 In February 1944 as preparation for Operation Overlord placed greater demands on Allied shipping Churchill cabled Wavell saying: I will certainly help you all I can but you must not ask the impossible . 348 Grain shipment requests continued to be turned down by the government throughout 1944 and Wavell complained to Churchill in October that the vital problems of India are being treated by His Majestys Government with neglect even sometimes with hostility and contempt . 346 350 The impact of British policies on the famine death toll remains controversial . 351 International conferences in 1942 Huge portraits of Churchill and Stalin Brisbane Australia 31 October 1941 On 20 May 1942 the Soviet Foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov arrived in London to sign a treaty of friendship. Molotov wanted it done on the basis of territorial concessions regarding Poland and the Baltic countries. Churchill and Eden worked for a compromise and a twenty-year treaty was formalised with the question of frontiers placed on hold. Molotov also sought a Second Front in Europe; Churchill confirmed preparations were in progress and made no promises on a date. 352 Churchill felt pleased with these negotiations. 353 However Rommel had launched his counter-offensive Operation Venice to begin the Battle of Gazala on 26 May. 353 The Allies were driven out of Libya and suffered a defeat in the fall of Tobruk on 21 June. Churchill was with Roosevelt when the news reached him and was shocked by the surrender of 35 000 troops which was apart from Singapore the heaviest blow he received in the war. 354 The Axis advance was halted at the First Battle of El Alamein in July and the Battle of Alam el Halfa in September. Both sides were exhausted and in need of reinforcements and supplies. 355 Churchill returned to Washington on 17 June. He and Roosevelt agreed on the implementation of Operation Torch as the necessary precursor to an invasion of Europe. Roosevelt had appointed General Dwight D. Eisenhower as commanding officer of the European Theater of Operations United States Army ETOUSA. Having received the news from North Africa Churchill obtained shipment from America to the Eighth Army of 300 Sherman tanks and 100 howitzers. He returned to Britain on 25 June and had to face another motion of no confidence this time in his direction of the war but again he won easily. 356 In August despite health concerns Churchill visited British forces in North Africa raising morale en route to Moscow for his first meeting with Stalin . He was accompanied by Roosevelts special envoy Averell Harriman . 357 He was in Moscow 1216 August and had lengthy meetings with Stalin. Though they got along well personally there was little chance of real progress given the state of the war. Stalin was desperate for the Allies to open the Second Front in Europe as Churchill had discussed with Molotov in May and the answer was the same. 358 El Alamein and Stalingrad While he was in Cairo in August Churchill appointed Field Marshal Alexander as Field Marshal Auchinleck s successor as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre. Command of the Eighth Army was given to General William Gott but he was shot down and killed while flying to Cairo and General Montgomery succeeded him. 359 Churchill meeting King Farouk in Cairo in December 1942 As 1942 drew to a close the tide of war began to turn with Allied victories in El Alamein and Stalingrad . Until November the Allies had been on the defensive but afterwards the Germans were. Churchill ordered church bells to be rung throughout Great Britain for the first time since 1940. 359 On 10 November knowing El Alamein was a victory he delivered one of his most memorable speeches at Mansion House in London: This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is perhaps the end of the beginning . 359 International conferences in 1943 Stalin Roosevelt and Churchill at the Tehran Conference in 1943 In January 1943 Churchill met Roosevelt at the Casablanca Conference . It was attended by General Charles de Gaulle from the Free French Forces . Stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of Stalingrad. Although Churchill expressed doubts on the matter the so-called Casablanca Declaration committed the Allies to securing unconditional surrender . 360 361 From Morocco Churchill went to Cairo Adana Cyprus Cairo again and Algiers . He arrived home on 7 February having been out of the country for a month. He addressed the Commons on the 11th and became seriously ill with pneumonia the following day necessitating more than a month of convalescence: he moved to Chequers . He returned to work in London on 15 March. 362 Churchill made two transatlantic crossings during the year meeting Roosevelt at the third Washington Conference in May and the first Quebec Conference in August. 363 In November Churchill and Roosevelt met Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference . 364 The most important conference of the year was 28 November to 1 December at Tehran where Churchill and Roosevelt met Stalin in the first of the Big Three meetings preceding those at Yalta and Potsdam . Roosevelt and Stalin co-operated in persuading Churchill to commit to opening of second front in western Europe and it was agreed Germany would be divided after the war but no decisions were made about how. 365 On their way back Churchill and Roosevelt held a Second Cairo Conference with Turkish president Ismet Inonu but were unable to gain commitment from Turkey to join the Allies. 366 Churchill went to Tunis arriving on 10 December initially as Eisenhowers guest soon afterwards Eisenhower took over as Supreme Allied Commander of the new SHAEF . Churchill became seriously ill with atrial fibrillation and was forced to remain in Tunis until after Christmas while specialists were drafted in to ensure recovery. Clementine and Colville arrived to keep him company; Colville had just returned to Downing Street after two years in the RAF. On 27 December the party went on to Marrakesh for convalescence. Feeling much better Churchill flew to Gibraltar on 14 January 1944 and sailed home on the King George V . He was back in London on 18 January and surprised MPs by attending Prime Ministers Questions in the Commons. Since 12 January 1943 when he set off for Casablanca Churchill had been abroad or seriously ill for 203 of the 371 days. 367 Invasions of Sicily and Italy Churchill in the Carthage theatre near the ancient Carthage Amphitheatre to address 3 000 British and American troops June 1943 In the autumn of 1942 after Churchills meeting with Stalin he was approached by Eisenhower commanding the North African Theater of Operations US Army NATOUSA and his aides on the subject of where the Western Allies should launch their first strike in Europe. According to General Mark W. Clark the Americans admitted a cross-Channel operation in the near future was utterly impossible . As an alternative Churchill recommended slitting the soft belly of the Mediterranean and persuaded them to invade Sicily and then mainland Italy after they had defeated the Afrika Korps. After the war Clark still agreed Churchills analysis was correct but added that when the Allies landed at Salerno they found Italy was a tough old gut . 368 The invasion of Sicily began on 9 July and was completed by 17 August. Churchill was not keen on Overlord as he feared an Anglo-American army in France might not be a match for the fighting efficiency of the Wehrmacht. He preferred peripheral operations including a plan called Operation Jupiter for an invasion of Norway. 369 Events in Sicily had an unexpected impact in Italy. King Victor Emmanuel sacked Mussolini on 25 July and appointed Marshal Badoglio as prime minister. Badoglio opened negotiations with the Allies which resulted in the Armistice of Cassibile on 3 September. In response the Germans activated Operation Achse and took control of most of Italy. 370 Although he still preferred Italy to Normandy as the Allies main route into the Third Reich Churchill was concerned about the strong German resistance at Salerno and after the Allies successfully gained their bridgehead at Anzio but still failed to break the stalemate he caustically said that instead of hurling a wildcat onto the shore the Allied force had become a stranded whale . 371 372 The big obstacle was Monte Cassino and it was not until May 1944 when it was finally overcome enabling the Allies to advance on Rome which was taken on 4 June. 373 Preparations for D-Day Churchill is greeted by a crowd in Quebec City Canada 1943 The difficulties in Italy caused Churchill to change heart about strategy; when the Anzio stalemate developed after his return to England from North Africa he threw himself into the planning of Overlord and set up meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff. These were attended by Eisenhower or his chief of staff General Walter Bedell Smith . Churchill was especially taken by the Mulberry harbours but was keen to make the most of Allied airpower which by 1944 had become overwhelming. 373 Churchill never lost his apprehension about the invasion and underwent mood fluctuation as D-Day approached. Jenkins says he faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when he defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier. 374 Need for post-war reform Churchill could not ignore the need for post-war reforms. The Beveridge Report with its five Giant Evils was published in November 1942 and assumed great importance amid popular acclaim. 375 Even so Churchill spent most of his focus on the war and saw reform in terms of tidying up. His attitude was demonstrated in a radio broadcast on 26 March 1944. He was obliged to devote most of it to reform and showed a distinct lack of interest. Colville said Churchill had broadcast indifferently and Harold Nicolson said that to many people Churchill came across the air as a worn and petulant old man . 376 In the end however it was demand for reform that decided the 1945 general election. Labour was perceived as the party that would deliver Beveridge. Attlee Bevin and Labours other coalition ministers were seen as working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate. 377 378 Defeat of Germany: June 1944 to May 1945 Churchills crossing of the Rhine river in Germany during Operation Plunder on 25 March 1945 D-Day: Allied invasion of Normandy Churchill was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day 6 June 1944 or at least D-Day1. His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF until he was effectively vetoed by the King. Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20 000 on D-Day but fewer than 8 000 died in all of June. 379 He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery whose HQ was five miles inland. That evening as he was returning to London the first V-1 flying bombs were launched. On 2223 July Churchill went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where he saw the Mulberry Harbour. 380 Quebec Conference September 1944 Churchill met Roosevelt at the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944. They reached agreement on the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but de-industrialise. Eden opposed it and was able to persuade Churchill to disown it. US Secretary of State Cordell Hull opposed it and convinced Roosevelt it was infeasible. 381 Moscow Conference October 1944 At the fourth Moscow conference in October 1944 Churchill and Eden met Stalin and Molotov. This conference has gained notoriety for the so-called Percentages agreement in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the Balkans . 382 By then the Soviet armies were in Rumania and Bulgaria. Churchill suggested a scale of predominance throughout the whole region so as not to as he put it get at cross-purposes in small ways . 383 He wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave it to Stalin who ticked it. The agreement was that Russia would have 90 control of Romania and 75 control of Bulgaria. The United Kingdom and United States would have 90 control of Greece. Hungary and Yugoslavia would be 50 each. 384 In 1958 five years after the account of this meeting was published in The Second World War Soviet authorities denied Stalin had accepted such an imperialist proposal . 382 Yalta Conference February 1945 Main article: Yalta Conference Churchill Roosevelt and Stalin at the Yalta Conference February 1945 From 30 January to 2 February 1945 Churchill and Roosevelt met for their Malta Conference ahead of the second Big Three event at Yalta from 4 to 11 February. 385 Yalta had massive implications for the post-war world. There were two predominant issues: the question of setting up the United Nations Organisation on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of Polands post-war status which Churchill saw as a test case for Eastern Europe. 386 Churchill faced criticism for the agreement on Poland. For example 27 Tory MPs voted against him when the matter was debated in the Commons at the end of the month. Jenkins however maintains that Churchill did as well as possible in difficult circumstances not least the fact that Roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide Churchill with meaningful support. 387 Another outcome of Yalta was the so-called Operation Keelhaul . The Western Allies agreed to the forcible repatriation of all Soviet citizens in the Allied zones including prisoners of war to the Soviet Union and the policy was later extended to all Eastern European refugees many of whom were anti-Communist. Keelhaul was implemented between August 1946 and May 1947. 388 389 Area bombing controversy Main article: Bombing of Dresden The destruction of Dresden February 1945 On the nights of 1315 February 1945 1 200 British and US bombers attacked Dresden which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front. 390 391 The attacks were part of an area bombing campaign initiated by Churchill in January with the intention of shortening the war. 392 Churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll of about 24 000. 393 On 28 March he decided to restrict area bombing 394 and sent a memo to General Ismay for the Chiefs of Staff Committee : 395 396 The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing..... I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives..... rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction however impressive. Historian Frederick Taylor has pointed out that the number of Soviets who died from German bombing was roughly equivalent to the number of Germans who died from Allied raids. 397 Jenkins asks if Churchill was moved more by foreboding than by regret but admits it is easy to criticise with the hindsight of victory. He adds that the area bombing campaign was no more reprehensible than President Truman s use of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki six months later. 394 Andrew Marr quoting Max Hastings says that Churchills memo was a calculated political attempt...to distance himself...from the rising controversy surrounding the area offensive . 396 VE Day Victory in Europe Day Churchill waving the Victory sign to the crowd in Whitehall on the day he broadcast to the nation that the war with Germany had been won 8 May 1945. On 7 May 1945 at the SHAEF headquarters in Reims the Allies accepted Germanys surrender . The next day was Victory in Europe Day VE Day when Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night. 398 Churchill went to Buckingham Palace where he appeared on the balcony with the Royal Family before a huge crowd of celebrating citizens. He went from the palace to Whitehall where he addressed another large crowd: God bless you all. This is your victory. In our long history we have never seen a greater day than this. Everyone man or woman has done their best . 399 He asked Bevin to come forward and share the applause. Bevin said: No Winston this is your day and proceeded to conduct the people in the singing of For Hes a Jolly Good Fellow . 399 In the evening Churchill made another broadcast correctly asserting that the defeat of Japan would follow in the coming months. 400 Later in the month France attempted to put down a nationalist uprising in the Syria . Churchill intervened and on 31 May gave de Gaulle an ultimatum to desist but this was ignored. In what became known as the Levant Crisis British forces from Transjordan were mobilised to restore order. The French outnumbered had no option but to return to their bases. De Gaulle felt humiliated and a diplomatic row broke out - Churchill reportedly told a colleague that de Gaulle was a great danger to peace and for Great Britain . 401 Operation Unthinkable Main article: Operation Unthinkable In May 1945 Winston Churchill commissioned the Chiefs of Staff Committee to provide its thoughts on a possible military campaign against the USSR code-named Operation Unthinkable . 402 One plan involved a surprise attack on Soviet troops stationed in Germany to impose the will of the United States and the British Empire on the Soviets. 403 The hypothetical start date for the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was set for 1 July 1945. 403 Caretaker government: May 1945 to July 1945 Main article: Churchill caretaker ministry With a general election looming and with Labour ministers refusing to continue the coalition Churchill resigned as prime minister on 23 May 1945. Later that day he accepted the Kings invitation to form a new government known officially as the National Government but sometimes called the caretaker ministry. It contained Conservatives National Liberals and a few non-party figures such as Sir John Anderson and Lord Woolton but not Labour or Archibald Sinclair s Official Liberals. Churchill was formally reappointed on 28 May. 404 405 Potsdam Conference Main article: Potsdam Conference Churchill Harry S. Truman and Stalin at the Potsdam Conference July 1945 Churchill was Great Britains representative at the Potsdam Conference when it opened on 17 July and was accompanied at its sessions by Eden and Attlee. They attended nine sessions in nine days before returning to England for their election counts. After the landslide Labour victory Attlee returned with Bevin as the new Foreign Secretary and there were five days of discussion. 406 Potsdam went badly for Churchill. Eden later described his performance as appalling saying he was unprepared and verbose. Churchill upset the Chinese exasperated the Americans and was easily led by Stalin whom he was supposed to be resisting. 407 General election July 1945 Main article: 1945 United Kingdom general election Churchill mishandled the election campaign by resorting to party politics and trying to denigrate Labour. 408 On 4 June he committed a serious gaffe by saying in a radio broadcast that a Labour government would require some form of Gestapo to enforce its agenda. 409 410 It backfired and Attlee made political capital by saying in his reply broadcast next day: The voice we heard last night was that of Mr Churchill but the mind was that of Lord Beaverbrook . Jenkins says that this broadcast was the making of Attlee . 411 Although polling day was 5 July the results did not become known until 26 July owing to the need to collect votes of those serving overseas. Clementine and daughter Mary had been at the count in Woodford Churchills new constituency and had returned to Downing Street to meet him for lunch. Churchill was unopposed by the major parties in Woodford but his majority over a sole independent candidate was much less than expected. He anticipated defeat by Labour and Mary later described the lunch as an occasion of Stygian gloom . 412 413 To Clementines suggestion that defeat might be a blessing in disguise Churchill retorted: At the moment it seems very effectively disguised . 412 That afternoon Churchills doctor Lord Moran commiserated with him on the ingratitude of the public to which Churchill replied: I wouldnt call it that. They have had a very hard time . 413 Having lost despite enjoying personal support amongst the population he resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Attlee who formed the first majority Labour government. 414 415 416 417 Many reasons have been given for Churchills defeat key being a widespread desire for reform and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead in peace. 418 419 Although the Conservative Party was unpopular many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as prime minister whatever the outcome or to have wrongly believed this would be possible. 420 Leader of the Opposition: 19451951 Main article: Later life of Winston Churchill Iron Curtain speech Churchill in 1949 Churchill continued to lead the Conservative Party and served as Leader of the Opposition . In 1946 he was in America from early January to late March. 421 It was on this trip he gave his Iron Curtain speech about the USSR and its creation of the Eastern Bloc . 422 Speaking on 5 March 1946 in the company of President Truman at Westminster College in Fulton Missouri Churchill declared: 423 From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw Berlin Prague Vienna Budapest Belgrade Bucharest and Sofia all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere. His view was that though the Soviet Union did not want war with the western Allies its entrenched position in Eastern Europe had made it impossible for the three great powers to provide the world with a triangular leadership . Churchills desire was much closer collaboration between Britain and America. Within the same speech he called for a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States 423 but emphasised the need for co-operation within the framework of the United Nations Charter. 424 European politics Churchill was an early proponent of pan-Europeanism having called for a United States of Europe in a 1930 article. He supported the creations of the Council of Europe in 1949 and the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 but his support was always with the firm proviso that Britain must not actually join any federal grouping. 425 426 427 Ireland Having lived in Ireland as a child Churchill always opposed its partition. As a minister in 1913 and again in 1921 he suggested that Ulster should be part of a united Ireland but with a degree of autonomy from an independent Irish government. He was always opposed on this by Ulster Unionists. 428 While he was Leader of the Opposition he told John Dulanty and Frederick Boland successive Irish ambassadors to London that he still hoped for reunification. 429 1950 and 1951 Elections Labour won the 1950 general election but with a much-reduced majority. 430 A fresh election was called the following year and the Conservatives won a majority. Prime Minister: 19511955 Main article: Second premiership of Winston Churchill Further information: Third Churchill ministry Election result and cabinet appointments Churchill with Queen Elizabeth II Prince Charles and Princess Anne 10 February 1953 Despite losing the popular vote the Conservatives won a majority of 17 seats in the October 1951 general election and Churchill became prime minister remaining in office until his resignation on 5 April 1955. 431 Eden his eventual successor was restored to Foreign Affairs. 432 Future prime minister Harold Macmillan was appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government with a manifesto commitment to build 300 000 new houses per year Churchills only real domestic concern. He achieved the target and in 1954 was promoted to Minister of Defence. 433 Health issues to eventual resignation Churchill was nearly 77 when he took office and not in good health following minor strokes. 434 By December 1951 George VI had become concerned about Churchills decline and intended asking him to stand down in favour of Eden but the King had his own health issues and died on 6 February 1952. 435 Churchill developed a friendship with Elizabeth II and in spring 1953 accepted the Order of the Garter at her request. 436 He was knighted as Sir Winston on 24 April 1953. 437 It was widely expected he would retire after the Queens Coronation in June 1953 but after Eden became seriously ill Churchill increased his own responsibilities by taking over at the Foreign Office. 438 439 440 Eden was incapacitated until the end of the year and never completely well again. 441 On the evening of 23 June 1953 Churchill suffered a serious stroke; the matter was kept secret and Churchill went to Chartwell to recuperate. He had recovered by November. 442 443 444 He retired in April 1955 and was succeeded by Eden. 445 Foreign affairs Churchill with Anthony Eden Dean Acheson and Harry Truman 5 January 1952 Churchill feared a global conflagration and firmly believed the only way to preserve peace and freedom was friendship and co-operation between Britain and America. He made four official transatlantic visits from January 1952 to July 1954. 446 He enjoyed a good relationship with Truman but difficulties arose over the planned European Defence Community EDC by which Truman hoped to reduce Americas military presence in West Germany. 447 Churchill wanted US military support of British interests in Egypt and the Middle East but while Truman expected British military involvement in Korea he viewed any US commitment to the Middle East as maintaining British imperialism. 448 The Americans recognised the British Empire was in terminal decline and had welcomed the Attlee governments policy of decolonisation. Churchill believed Britains position as a world power depended on the empires continued existence. 449 Churchill meeting Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie October 22 1954 one of the UKs African allies in World War II Churchill had been obliged to recognise Colonel Nasser s revolutionary government of Egypt which took power in 1952 . Much to Churchills dismay agreement was reached in October 1954 on the phased evacuation of British troops from their Suez base. Britain agreed to terminate its rule in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan by 1956 though this was in return for Nassers abandonment of Egyptian claims over the region. 450 Elsewhere the Malayan Emergency a guerrilla war fought by Communist fighters against Commonwealth forces had begun in 1948 and continued until 1960. Churchills government maintained the military response to the crisis and adopted a similar strategy for the Mau Mau Uprising in British Kenya 19521960. 451 Churchill was uneasy about the election of Eisenhower as Trumans successor. After Stalin died in March 1953 Churchill sought a summit meeting with the Soviets but Eisenhower refused out of fear the Soviets would use it for propaganda. 452 438 453 By July Churchill was deeply regretting that the Democrats had not been returned. Churchill believed Eisenhower did not fully comprehend the danger posed by the H-bomb and he greatly distrusted Eisenhowers Secretary of State John Foster Dulles . 454 Churchill hosted Eisenhower at the Three-Powers Bermuda Conference with French Prime Minister Joseph Laniel in December; 455 456 they met again in JuneJuly 1954 at the White House. 457 In the end the Soviets proposed a four-power summit but it did not meet until July 1955 three months after Churchills retirement. 458 459 Later life: 19551965 Main article: Later life of Winston Churchill Retirement: 19551964 Elizabeth II offered to create Churchill Duke of London but he declined because of the objections of Randolph who would have inherited the title. 460 Although publicly supportive Churchill was privately scathing about Edens handling of the Suez Crisis and Clementine believed that many of his visits to the US in the following years were attempts to repair Anglo-American relations. 461 Churchill remained an MP until he stood down at the 1964 general election . 462 By the time of the 1959 general election he seldom attended the House of Commons. Despite the Conservative landslide in 1959 his own majority fell by more than 1 000. He spent most of his retirement at Chartwell or at his London home in Hyde Park Gate and became a habitue of high society at La Pausa on the French Riviera . 463 In June 1962 aged 87 Churchill had a fall in Monte Carlo and broke his hip. He was flown home to a London hospital where he remained for 3 weeks. Jenkins says Churchill was never the same after this. 462 In 1963 US President John F. Kennedy acting under authorisation granted by an Act of Congress proclaimed him an honorary citizen of the United States but he was unable to attend the White House ceremony. 462 There has been speculation he became very depressed in his final years but this has been emphatically denied by his secretary Anthony Montague Browne who was with him for his last 10 years. Montague Browne wrote that he never heard Churchill refer to depression and certainly did not suffer from it. 464 Death funeral and memorials Main article: Death and state funeral of Winston Churchill Churchills grave at St Martins Church Bladon Churchill suffered his final stroke on 10 January 1965 and died on 24 January. 462 465 Like the Duke of Wellington in 1852 and William Gladstone in 1898 Churchill was given a state funeral. 462 His coffin lay in state at Westminster Hall for three days. The funeral ceremony was at St Pauls Cathedral on 30 January. 462 465 Afterwards the coffin was taken by boat along the River Thames to Waterloo Station and from there by a special train to the family plot at St Martins Church Bladon . 466 465 Worldwide numerous memorials have been dedicated to Churchill. His statue in Parliament Square was unveiled by his widow Clementine in 1973 and is one of only twelve in the square. 467 468 Elsewhere in London the Cabinet War Rooms have been renamed the Churchill War Rooms . 469 Churchill College Cambridge was established as a national memorial to Churchill. In a 2002 BBC poll attracting 447 423 votes he was voted the greatest Briton of all time his nearest rival being Isambard Kingdom Brunel some 56 000 votes behind. 470 He is one of only 8 people to be granted honorary citizenship of the United States and the first. 471 The United States Navy honoured him in 1999 by naming a Arleigh Burke -class destroyer as the USS Winston S. Churchill . 472 Other memorials in North America include the National Churchill Museum in Fulton where he made the 1946 Iron Curtain speech; Churchill Square in Edmonton Alberta; and the Winston Churchill Range a mountain range northwest of Lake Louise also in Alberta which was renamed after Churchill in 1956. 473 Artist historian and writer Main articles: Winston Churchill as painter and Winston Churchill as writer Further information: 1953 Nobel Prize in Literature Allies 1995 by Lawrence Holofcener a sculptural group depicting Franklin D. Roosevelt and Churchill in Bond Street London Churchill was a prolific writer. His output included a novel Savrola two biographies memoirs histories and press articles. Two of his most famous works were his six-volume memoir The Second World War and the four-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples . 474 In recognition of his mastery of historical and biographical description and oratorial output Churchill received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953. 475 He used either Winston S. Churchill or Winston Spencer Churchill as his pen name to avoid confusion with the American novelist Winston Churchill whom he had a friendly correspondence with. 476 For many years he relied on his press articles to assuage his financial worries. 477 Churchill became an accomplished amateur artist beginning after his resignation from the Admiralty in 1915. 478 Often using the pseudonym Charles Morin 479 he completed hundreds of paintings many of which are on show in Chartwell and in private collections. 480 Churchill was an amateur bricklayer constructing buildings and garden walls at Chartwell. 479 He joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers but was expelled after he rejoined the Conservative Party. 479 He bred butterflies. 481 He was known for his love of animals and always had several pets mainly cats but also dogs pigs lambs bantams goats and fox cubs among others. 482 Churchill has been quoted as saying that Dogs look up to you cats look down on you. Give me a pig! He looks you in the eye and treats you as an equal . 483 Legacy and assessments Main articles: Political positions of Winston Churchill and List of honours of Winston Churchill See also: Churchill Archives Centre A man of destiny The statue of Churchill 1973 by Ivor Roberts-Jones in Parliament Square London Jenkins concludes his biography of Churchill by comparing him favourably with William Gladstone and summarising: 466 I now put Churchill with all his idiosyncrasies his indulgences his occasional childishness but also his genius his tenacity and his persistent ability right or wrong successful or unsuccessful to be larger than life as the greatest human being ever to occupy 10 Downing Street. Churchill always self-confidently believed himself to be a man of destiny . 484 Because of this he lacked restraint and could be reckless. 485 486 His self-belief manifested in his affinity with war of which according to Sebastian Haffner he exhibited a profound and innate understanding . 487 Churchill considered himself a military genius but that made him vulnerable to failure and Paul Addison says the Gallipoli disaster was the greatest blow his self-image was ever to sustain . 488 Jenkins points out that although Churchill was exhilarated by war he was never indifferent to the suffering it causes. 489 Political ideology Part of the Politics series on Toryism Characteristics Agrarianism Classicism Counterrevolution High Church Anglicanism High culture Interventionism Loyalism Monarchism Noblesse oblige Traditionalism Traditionalist Catholicism Royalism Unionism General topics Cavaliers Cavalier Parliament Chateau Clique Conservative corporatism Divine right of kings Family Compact Jacobitism Oxford Movement Powellism People Robert Filmer 1st Earl of Clarendon Roger LEstrange 1st Earl of Rochester 1st Viscount Bolingbroke Samuel Johnson 3rd Earl of Bute 1st Duke of Wellington Walter Scott Stanley Baldwin G.

The exception was during his wartime coalition when he was reliant upon the support of his Labour colleagues. 502 503 Churchill had long been regarded as an enemy of the working class and his response to the Rhondda Valley unrest and his anti-socialist rhetoric brought condemnation from socialists who saw him as a reactionary . 504 His role in opposing the General Strike earned the enmity of strikers and most members of the Labour movement. 505 Paradoxically Churchill was supportive of trade unionism which he saw as the antithesis of socialism . 506 On the other hand his detractors did not take Churchills domestic reforms into account 507 for he was in many respects a radical and reformer 508 but always with the intention of preserving the existing social structure 509 displaying what Addison calls the attitude of a benevolent paternalist . 510 Jenkins himself a senior Labour minister remarked that Churchill had a substantial record as a social reformer for his work in his ministerial career. 511 Similarly Rhodes James thought that Churchills achievements were considerable . 512 Imperialism and racial views See also: Racial views of Winston Churchill The British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921 Churchill was a staunch imperialist and monarchist and consistently exhibited a romanticised view of the British Empire and reigning monarch especially during his last term as premier. 513 514 515 Churchill has been described as a liberal imperialist 516 who saw British imperialism as a form of altruism that benefited its subject peoples. 517 He advocated against black or indigenous self-rule in Africa Australia the Caribbean the Americas and India believing the British Empire maintained the welfare of those who lived in the colonies. 347 According to Addison Churchill was opposed to immigration from the Commonwealth. 518 Addison makes the point that Churchill opposed anti-Semitism as in 1904 when he was critical of the proposed Aliens Bill and argues he would never have tried to stoke up racial animosity against immigrants or to persecute minorities . 519 In the 1920s Churchill supported Zionism but believed that communism was the product of an international Jewish conspiracy . 520 Although this belief was not unique among politicians few had his stature 521 and the article he wrote on the subject was criticised by The Jewish Chronicle . 522 Churchill made disparaging remarks about non-white ethnicities throughout his life. Philip Murphy partly attributes the strength of this vitriol to an almost childish desire to shock his inner circle. 523 Churchills response to the Bengal famine was criticised by contemporaries as slow a controversy later increased by the publication of private remarks made to Secretary for India Leo Amery in which Churchill allegedly said aid would be inadequate because Indians were breeding like rabbits . 523 524 Philip Murphy says that following the independence of India in 1947 Churchill adopted a pragmatic stance towards empire although he continued to use imperial rhetoric. During his second term as prime minister he was seen as a moderating influence on Britains suppression of armed insurgencies in Malaya and Kenya; he argued that ruthless policies contradicted British values and international opinion. 523 Cultural depictions Main article: Cultural depictions of Winston Churchill While biographies by Addison Gilbert Jenkins and Rhodes James are among the most acclaimed works about Churchill he has been the subject of numerous others. David Freeman counted 62 in English to the end of the 20th century. 525 At a public ceremony in Westminster Hall on 30 November 1954 Churchills 80th birthday the joint Houses of Parliament presented him with a full-length portrait of himself painted by Graham Sutherland . 526 Churchill and Clementine reportedly hated it and she had it destroyed. 527 528 Biographical films include Young Winston 1972 directed by Richard Attenborough and featuring Simon Ward in the title role; Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years 1981 starring Robert Hardy ; The Gathering Storm 2002 starring Albert Finney as Churchill; Into the Storm 2009 starring Brendan Gleeson as Churchill; Darkest Hour 2017 starring Gary Oldman as Churchill. John Lithgow played Churchill in The Crown 20162019. Finney Gleeson Oldman and Lithgow all won awards for their performances. 529 530 531 532 Family Main article: Family of Winston Churchill See also: List of Winston Churchills relatives in politics Churchill married Clementine Hozier in September 1908. 533 They remained married for 57 years until his death. 109 Churchill was aware of the strain his career placed on their marriage. 534 According to Colville he had an affair in the 1930s with Doris Castlerosse 535 although this is discounted by Andrew Roberts . 536 The Churchills first child Diana was born in July 1909; 537 Randolph in May 1911. 147 Sarah was born in October 1914 170 and Marigold in November 1918. 199 Marigold died in August 1921 from sepsis . 538 On 15 September 1922 the Churchills last child Mary was born. Later that month the Churchills bought Chartwell which would be their home until Winstons death in 1965. 539 540 Notes The surname is the double-barrelled Spencer Churchill unhyphenated but he is known by the surname Churchill . His father dropped the Spencer. 1 See also Shall We All Commit Suicide? References Citations Price 2009 p. 12. Brendon Piers 2023 Packwood Allen ed.
