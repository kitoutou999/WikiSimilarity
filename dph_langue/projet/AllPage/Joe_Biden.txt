Early life 19421965 Main article: Early life and career of Joe Biden Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20 1942 2 at St. Marys Hospital in Scranton Pennsylvania 3 to Catherine Eugenia Jean Biden nee Finnegan 19172010 and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. 19152002 4 5 The oldest child in a Catholic family of mostly Irish descent along with English and French; he has a sister Valerie and two brothers Francis and James . The Biden surname traces back to William Biden an ancestor of his who emigrated from England to Maryland around 1820. 6 Bidens father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946 7 but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old 8 9 10 and for several years the family lived with Bidens maternal grandparents in Scranton. 11 Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Bidens father could not find steady work. 12 Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten 13 the family lived in an apartment in Claymont Delaware before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield Delaware . 14 15 9 11 Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle. 11 12 16 At Archmere Academy in Claymont 17 Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team. 11 18 Though a poor student he was class president in his junior and senior years. 19 20 He graduated in 1961. 19 At the University of Delaware in Newark Biden briefly played freshman football 21 22 and as an unexceptional student 23 earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science . 24 25 Biden had a stutter and has mitigated it since his early twenties. 26 He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror. 20 27 Marriages law school and early career 19661973 Main article: Early career of Joe Biden See also: Family of Joe Biden Biden married Neilia Hunter a student at Syracuse University on August 27 1966 24 28 after overcoming her parents disinclination for her to wed a Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles New York . 29 They had three children: Joseph R. Beau Biden III Robert Hunter Biden and Naomi Christina Amy Biden. 24 Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. In his first year of law school he failed a course because he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote but the failing grade was later stricken. His grades were relatively poor and he graduated 76th in a class of 85 students. 23 He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969. 2 Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett in 1968 and he later said thought of myself as a Republican . 30 31 He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry s conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican Russell W. Peterson who defeated Terry in 1968. 30 Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden but he registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon . 30 Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook In 1969 Biden practiced law first as a public defender and then at a law firm headed by a locally active Democrat 32 30 who named him to the Democratic Forum a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party; 33 Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat. 30 He and another attorney also formed a law firm. 32 Corporate law did not appeal to him and criminal law did not pay well. 11 He supplemented his income by managing properties. 34 Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs. 35 36 The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts. 37 38 39 Biden won the general election defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick and took office on January 5 1971. 40 41 He served until January 1 1973 and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift. 42 43 During his time on the county council Biden opposed large highway projects which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods. 43 Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixons conduct of the war. 44 While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University Biden obtained five student draft deferments at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. Based on a physical examination he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008 a spokesperson for Biden said his having had asthma as a teenager was the reason for the deferment. 45 1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware Main article: 1972 United States Senate election in Delaware Neilia Hunter Joe Hunter Naomi Christina and Beau Biden c. 1972 Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and with minimal campaign funds he was thought to have no chance of winning. 32 11 Family members managed and staffed the campaign which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers 46 an approach made feasible by Delawares small size. 34 He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell . 32 His platform focused on the environment withdrawal from Vietnam civil rights mass transit equitable taxation health care and public dissatisfaction with politics as usual . 32 46 A few months before the election Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points 32 but his energy attractive young family and ability to connect with voters emotions worked to his advantage 16 and he won with 50.5 of the vote. 46 Death of wife and daughter A few weeks after Biden was elected senator his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin Delaware on December 18 1972. 24 47 Neilias station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau aged 3 and Hunter aged 2 were in the car and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries. 48 Biden considered resigning to care for them 16 but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to. 49 Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt. 50 51 He wrote that he felt God had played a horrible trick on him 52 and had trouble focusing on work. 53 54 Second marriage Biden and his second wife Jill met in 1975 and married in 1977. Biden met teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date . 55 They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17 1977 56 57 and spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian Peoples Republic . 58 59 Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life. 60 The couple attends Mass at St. Josephs on the Brandywine in Greenville Delaware . 61 62 63 In 1981 the couple had a daughter Ashley Biden . 24 She is a social worker and married to physician Howard Krein . 64 Jill helped raise her stepsons Hunter and Beau who were seven and eight respectively at the time of her marriage. Hunter has worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings personal life and legal troubles have come under significant scrutiny during his fathers presidency. 65 66 Beau became an Army judge-advocate in Iraq and later Delaware attorney general ; 67 he died of brain cancer in 2015. 68 69 Teaching From 1991 to 2008 as an adjunct professor Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law . 70 71 He sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class. 72 73 74 U.S. Senate 19732009 Main article: U.S. Senate career of Joe Biden Senate activities Biden with President Jimmy Carter 1978 Secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center in January 1973. 75 48 Present were his sons Beau whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident and Hunter and other family members. 75 48 At age 30 he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history . 76 To see his sons Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C. 77 74 minutes each wayand maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate. 16 Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 Biden was reelected in 1978 1984 1990 1996 2002 and 2008 regularly receiving about 60 of the vote. 78 He was junior senator to William Roth who was first elected in 1970 until Roth was defeated in 2000. 79 As of 2024 update he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history. 80 During his early years in the Senate Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability. 81 In a 1974 interview he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties senior citizens concerns and healthcare but conservative on other issues including abortion and military conscription . 82 Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary . 83 Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election . Biden also worked on arms control . 84 85 After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter Biden met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committees objections. 86 He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administrations support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid . 30 In the mid-1970s Biden was one of the Senates strongest opponents of race-integration busing . His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies. 87 In his first Senate campaign Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation as in the South but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely. 88 Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. 87 He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure which President Carter signed into law in 1978. 89 Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan 1984 Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the laws worst provisions and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time. 90 In 1994 Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act which included a ban on assault weapons 91 92 and the Violence Against Women Act 93 which he has called his most significant legislation. 94 The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration; 95 96 in 2019 Biden called his role in passing the bill a big mistake citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill trapped an entire generation . 97 Biden meeting with attorney general Janet Reno 1993 Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life thereby banning gay people from serving in the armed forces. 98 99 In 1996 he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same. 100 In 2015 the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges . 101 Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations saying its going to be a cold day in hell before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers. 102 He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton . 103 During the 2000s Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers. 16 Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000 but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act 16 with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it. 104 As a senator Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security. 78 105 Brain surgeries In February 1988 after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm . 106 107 While recuperating he suffered a pulmonary embolism a serious complication. 107 After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May 107 108 his recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months. 109 Senate Judiciary Committee Biden speaking at the signing of the 1994 Crime Bill with President Bill Clinton . Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary . He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997. 110 As chair Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings. 16 When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988 Biden reversed his approvalgiven in an interview the previous yearof a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered 111 but at the hearings close Biden was praised for his fairness humor and courage. 111 112 Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents 16 Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Borks strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text. 112 Borks nomination was rejected in the committee by a 59 vote 112 and then in the full Senate 4258. 113 During Clarence Thomass nomination hearings in 1991 Bidens questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them 114 and Thomas later wrote that Bidens questions were akin to beanballs . 115 After the committee hearing closed the public learned that Anita Hill a University of Oklahoma law school professor had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together. 116 117 Biden had known of some of these charges but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify. 16 The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment. 118 The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 5248 vote with Biden opposed. 16 Liberal legal advocates and womens groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill. 118 In 2019 he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied. 119 Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator Biden accompanies President Clinton and other officials to Bosnia and Herzegovina December 1997. Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009. 120 His positions were generally liberal internationalist . 84 121 He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party. 120 121 During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy. 122 Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991 121 siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators. He said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition . 123 Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. 84 Once the Bosnian War broke out Biden was among the first to call for the lift and strike policy. 84 120 The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy fearing Balkan entanglement. 84 121 In April 1993 Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic . 124 Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement. 124 Biden has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his proudest moment in public life related to foreign policy. 121 In 1999 during the Kosovo War Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia . 84 He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution which called on Clinton to use all necessary force including ground troops to confront Milosevic over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo . 121 125 Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq Main article: War on terror Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi in Baghdad in 2004. Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan saying Whatever it takes we should do it. 126 As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to eliminate that threat. 127 In October 2002 he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq . 121 As chair of the committee he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent history and status of Saddam and his secular government which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda and touted Iraqs fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction . 128 Biden eventually became a critic of the war and called his vote and role a mistake but did not push for withdrawal. 121 124 He supported the appropriations for the occupation but argued that the war should be internationalized that more soldiers were needed and that the Bush administration should level with the American people about its cost and length. 120 125 By late 2006 Bidens stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007 121 124 saying General David Petraeus was dead flat wrong in believing the surge could work. 129 Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states. 130 Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing the plan called for a third way : federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds Shiites and Sunnis breathing room in their own regions. 131 In September 2007 a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate 132 but the idea failed to gain traction. 129 1988 and 2008 presidential campaigns 1988 campaign Main article: Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign Biden speaks at a campaign event 1987 Biden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9 1987. 133 He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image his speaking ability his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings and his appeal to Baby Boomers ; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president after John F. Kennedy . 30 134 135 He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate. 134 135 By August his campaigns messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries 136 and in September he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock . 137 Bidens speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions 138 139 but did not on two occasions in late August. 140 : 230232 139 Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988 forming an enduring friendship. 141 Earlier that year Biden had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy for which his aides took blame and a short phrase from John F. Kennedys inaugural address ; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey . 142 Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit and that one of his rivals for the nomination Jesse Jackson had called him to point out that he Jackson had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used. 16 23 A few days later an incident was publicized in which while in law school Biden had taken text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations. 23 He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks. 143 At Bidens request the Delaware Supreme Courts Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules. 144 Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college that he attended law school on a full scholarship that he had graduated in the top half of his class 145 146 and that he had marched in the civil rights movement . 147 The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures 148 and on September 23 1987 Biden withdrew his candidacy saying it had been overrun by the exaggerated shadow of his past mistakes. 149 2008 campaign Main article: Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign Biden campaigns at a house party in Creston Iowa July 2007. After exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles in January 2007 Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections . 78 150 151 During his campaign Biden focused on the Iraq War his record as chairman of major Senate committees and his foreign-policy experience. 152 Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani Theres only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun and a verb and 911 . 153 Biden had difficulty raising funds struggled to draw people to his rallies and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton . 154 He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates . In the first contest on January 3 2008 Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates. 155 He withdrew from the race that evening. 156 Despite its lack of success Bidens 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world. 157 : 336 In particular it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee they had not been close: Biden resented Obamas quick rise to political stardom 129 158 while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing. 157 : 28 337338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007 Obama appreciated Bidens campaign style and appeal to working-class voters and Biden said he became convinced Obama was the real deal . 158 157 : 28 337338 2008 and 2012 vice presidential campaigns 2008 campaign Main articles: Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign and 2008 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection Biden speaks at the August 23 2008 vice presidential announcement at the Old State Capitol in Springfield Illinois . Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration. 159 In early August Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility 159 and developed a strong personal rapport. 158 On August 22 2008 Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate . 160 The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience. 161 Others pointed out Bidens appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters. 162 163 Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver . 164 Bidens vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee Alaska governor Sarah Palin . 165 166 Under instructions from the campaign Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks such as one he made about Obamas being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office which had attracted negative attention. 167 168 Privately Bidens remarks frustrated Obama. How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid? he asked. 157 : 411414 419 Obama campaign staffers called Bidens blunders Joe bombs and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions which in turn irked Biden. 169 Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership. 157 : 411414 As the 20072008 financial crisis reached a peak in September 2008 and the proposed Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 became a major factor in the campaign Biden voted for the 700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which passed in the Senate 7425. 170 On October 2 2008 he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis . Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters expectations Biden had won the debate overall. 171 On November 4 2008 Obama and Biden were elected with 53 of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain and Palins 173. 172 173 174 At the same time Biden was running for vice president he was also running for reelection to the Senate 175 as permitted by Delaware law. 78 On November 4 he was reelected to the Senate defeating Republican Christine ODonnell . 176 Having won both races Biden made a point of waiting to resign from the Senate until he was sworn in for his seventh term on January 6 2009. 177 Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15 supporting the release of the second 350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program 178 and resigned from the Senate later that day. 179 2012 campaign Main article: Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign In October 2010 Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election 180 but with Obamas popularity on the decline White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton. 181 The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama 181 and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea. 182 Bidens May 2012 statement that he was absolutely comfortable with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obamas position which had been described as evolving . 183 Biden made his statement without administration consent and Obama and his aides were quite irked since Obama had planned to shift position several months later in the build-up to the party convention. 169 184 185 Gay rights advocates seized upon Bidens statement 184 and within days Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage an action in part forced by Bidens remarks. 186 Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out 187 188 while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart. 184 The Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012. 189 190 An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would put yall back in chains once again drew attention to Bidens propensity for colorful remarks. 189 191 192 Obama watching Biden debate Paul Ryan in the vice-presidential debate on Air Force One In the first presidential debate of the general election President Obamas performance was considered surprisingly lackluster. 193 Time magazines Joe Klein called it one of the most inept performances Ive ever seen by a sitting president . 194 Over the next few days Obamas lead over Romney collapsed 195 putting pressure on Biden to stop the bleeding with a strong showing against the Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan . 196 197 Some political analysts considered Bidens performance against Ryan in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career 198 199 and a key factor in Obamas rebound in the polls and eventual victory over Romney. 200 201 The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Bidens use of the phrase a bunch of malarkey in response to an attack by Ryan on the administrations response to the September 11 2012 attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi . 202 203 Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign. 204 On November 6 Obama and Biden won reelection 205 over Romney and Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51 of the popular vote. 206 Vice presidency 20092017 See also: Presidency of Barack Obama First term 20092013 Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush s vice president Dick Cheney and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency. 207 He was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States on January 20 2009. 208 He was the first vice president from Delaware 209 and the first Roman Catholic vice president. 210 211 Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player who does a bunch of things that dont show up in the stat sheet . 212 Biden visited Kosovo in May and affirmed the U.S. position that its independence is irreversible . 213 Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21 000 new troops to Afghanistan 214 215 but his skepticism was valued 216 and in 2009 Bidens views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy. 217 Biden visited Iraq about every two months 129 becoming the administrations point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there. 216 More generally overseeing Iraq policy became Bidens responsibility: Obama was said to have said Joe you do Iraq. 218 By 2012 Biden had made eight trips there but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011. 190 219 Biden being sworn in as vice president on January 20 2009 Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession . 220 During this period Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred 216 and when he completed that role in February 2011 he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent. 221 Bidens off-message response to a question in late April 2009 during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak led to a swift retraction by the White House. 222 The remark revived Bidens reputation for gaffes . 223 217 224 Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009 Biden acknowledged that the administration had misread how bad the economy was but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. 225 A hot mic picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was a big fucking deal on March 23 2010. Despite their different personalities Obama and Biden formed a friendship partly based around Obamas daughter Sasha and Bidens granddaughter Maisy who attended Sidwell Friends School together. 169 President Obama congratulates Biden for his role in shaping the debt ceiling deal which led to the Budget Control Act of 2011 . Members of the Obama administration said Bidens role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions. 226 Rahm Emanuel White House chief of staff said that Biden helped counter groupthink . 212 Obama said The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together he really forces people to think and defend their positions to look at things from every angle and that is very valuable for me. 216 The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington often entertaining their grandchildren and regularly returned to their home in Delaware. 227 Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party. 180 Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel Bidens past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important. 228 229 He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty . 228 229 In December 2010 Bidens advocacy for a middle ground followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell were instrumental in producing the administrations compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts . 229 230 The package passed as the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 . Biden Obama and the national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of the May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden . Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress in March 2011 to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown. 231 The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months but Bidens relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011 signed on August 2 2011 the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed. 232 233 234 Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden 190 235 lest failure adversely affect Obamas reelection prospects. 236 237 Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control to implement in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012. 238 Later that month during the final days before the United States fell off the fiscal cliff Bidens relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013. 239 240 It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels. 240 Second term 20132017 Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20 2013 at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle his official residence with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding a public ceremony took place on January 21. 241 Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act 2014 which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 . This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations. 242 243 244 Biden in Morocco November 2014 Bidens Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments such as the White House Council on Women and Girls begun in the first term as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs. 245 246 He talked about sexual violence while introducing Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016 receiving a standing ovation from the audience. 247 Biden favored arming Syrias rebel fighters . 248 As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014 renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006 with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along. 249 250 Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL to the gates of hell . 251 Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency the most of any president or vice president. 252 In August 2016 Biden visited Serbia where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War. 253 Biden with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem March 9 2016 Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction. 254 Role in the 2016 presidential campaign During his second term Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination . 255 With his family many friends and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race and with Hillary Clinton s favorability ratings in decline at that time Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a Draft Biden 2016 PAC was established. 255 256 257 By late 2015 Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son Beaus recent death had largely drained his emotional energy and said nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless theyre willing to give it 110 of who they are. 258 On October 21 speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016. 259 260 261 Subsequent activities 20172019 Biden with Barack Obama and Donald Trump at the latters inauguration on January 20 2017 After leaving the vice presidency Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement .

Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests putting him in the lead overall. 302 Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10. 303 In late March 2020 Tara Reade one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993. 304 There were inconsistencies between Reades 2019 and 2020 allegations. 304 305 Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation. 306 307 When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8 2020 Biden became the Democratic Partys presumptive nominee for president. 308 On April 13 Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes. 309 Former president Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day. 310 On August 11 Biden announced U.S. senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket. 311 On August 18 2020 Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election . 312 313 Presidential transition Main article: Presidential transition of Joe Biden 2020 electoral vote results.

He defeated the incumbent Donald Trump becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992 . Trump refused to concede insisting the election had been stolen from him through voter fraud challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes in an attempt to overturn the election results . 314 Bidens transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate. 315 On November 23 General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration. 316 On January 6 2021 during Congress electoral vote count Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol saying We will never give up.

In the meantime migrant adults are being sent back Biden said in reference to the continuation of the Trump administrations Title 42 policy for quick deportations. 342 Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them before they were sent to sponsors leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help. 343 On April 14 Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11 signaling an end to the countrys direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years. 344 In February 2020 the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1 2021. 345 Bidens decision met with a wide range of reactions from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support. 346 On April 2223 Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 5052 by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
