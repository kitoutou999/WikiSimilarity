A shooting guard he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association NBA. Widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential players of all time Bryant won five NBA championships and was an 18-time All-Star 15-time member of the All-NBA Team 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player MVP and a two-time NBA Finals MVP . He ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring . Bryant was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. The son of NBA player Joe Bryant Bryant was born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy. Recognized as the top American high-school basketball player while at Philadelphia suburb Lower Merion Bryant declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th pick; he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest and was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille ONeal the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002 . In 2003 Bryant was charged with sexual assault . Charges were dropped after the accuser refused to testify and a lawsuit was settled out of court with Bryant issuing an apology and admitting to a sexual encounter he maintained was consensual. After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals ONeal was traded and Bryant became the franchises cornerstone. He led the NBA in scoring in the 200506 and 200607 seasons. On January 22 2006 Bryant scored a career-high 81 points the second most scored in a single NBA game behind Wilt Chamberlains 100-point game . Bryant led the team to championships in 2009 and 2010 and was named NBA Finals MVP both times. He continued to be among the leagues premier players through the 201213 season when he suffered a torn achilles tendon . The last years of his playing career were hampered by injuries and limited playing time. Bryant retired after the 201516 season . In 2017 the Lakers retired both his Nos. 8 and 24 making Bryant the only player in NBA history to have multiple numbers retired by the same franchise. The all-time leading scorer in Lakers history Bryant was the first guard in NBA history to play 20 seasons . His 18 All-Star designations are the third most . His four NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in history. Bryant gave himself the nickname Black Mamba in the mid-2000s and the epithet became widely adopted by the public. He won gold medals on the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympic teams . In 2018 Bryant won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Dear Basketball 2017. 3 In January 2020 Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were among nine people who died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas California . 4 A number of tributes and memorials were issued and the All-Star MVP Award was renamed in Bryants honor. 5 Early life Bryant was born on August 23 1978 in Philadelphia 6 the youngest of three children and the only son of Pamela Cox Bryant and former NBA player Joe Bryant . He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John Chubby Cox . 7 Bryants parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe from Japan which they saw on a restaurant menu possibly in Philadelphia. 8 9 His middle name Bean was derived from his fathers nickname Jellybean . 10 Bryants family was Catholic and he was brought up with this faith. 11 12 13 Bryant started playing basketball at the age of three 14 and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. 15 When Bryant was six his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball. 16 17 After two years they moved first to Reggio Calabria then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia . Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. 18 He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia which Kobe considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made. 19 20 Kobe began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia. 21 22 His grandfather mailed him videos of NBA games for him to study. 23 Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports from which Kobe learned more about basketball. 24 From 1987 to 1989 his father played for Olimpia Basket Pistoia where he paired with former Detroit Pistons player Leon Douglas . Kobe worked at the games as a ball and mop boy and practiced shooting at halftime. Douglas said At every one of our games at halftime it was the Kobe show. Hed get out there and get his shot up. Wed come out of the locker room at halftime and have to chase him off the court . 25 Bryant also learned to play soccer and his favorite soccer team was A.C. Milan . 26 27 During summers Bryant returned to the United States to play in a basketball summer league. 28 When he was 13 Bryant and his family moved back to Philadelphia where he enrolled in the eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School . 18 29 High school 19921996 Bryants retired No. 33 jersey and banner at the Lower Merion High School gym in Ardmore Pennsylvania Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high-school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion . He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman. 30 Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merions varsity team but the team finished with a 420 record. 30 31 The following three years the Aces compiled a 7713 record with Bryant playing all five positions. 30 During his junior year Bryant averaged 31.1 points 10.4 rebounds 5.2 assists 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals 32 and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination 33 34 attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. 33 Duke Michigan North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list. However after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros . 33 At Adidas ABCD Camp Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award 35 while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom . 36 While in high school then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team where he played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse . 37 As a senior Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run he averaged 30.8 points 12 rebounds 6.5 assists 4 steals and 3.8 blocked shots in leading the Aces to a 313 record. 38 Bryant finished his high-school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania s all-time leading scorer at 2 883 points surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons . 39 Bryant received several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. These included being named Naismith High School Player of the Year Gatorade Mens National Basketball Player of the Year a McDonalds All-American a first-team Parade All-American and a USA Today All-USA First Team player. 40 41 Bryants varsity coach Greg Downer commented that he was a complete player who dominates and praised his work ethic even as the teams top player. 38 42 In 1996 Bryant took RB singer Brandy to her Hollywood High senior prom. 43 Ultimately the 17-year-old Bryant decided to go directly into the NBA becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so. 30 His news was met with a significant publicity at a time when prep-to-pro NBA players were not very common Garnett being the only exception in 20 years. 30 His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission to any college Bryant chose 8 44 but he did not officially visit any campuses. 42 In 2012 Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonalds All-Americans for his high school play as well as his later accomplishments. 45 Professional career 1996 NBA draft If you closed your eyes and thought a little bit you might have thought you were watching Michael Jordan . He did everything well beyond well. He was exceptional in everything that he did. And then we commented as I recall on how reminiscent he was of Michael. Jan Volk the Celtics general manager on Kobe Bryant during a pre-draft workout in 1996 46 Before the 1996 NBA draft Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and according to then-Laker general manager Jerry West marched over these people. 47 The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a players draft rights to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille ONeal . Bill Branch the Charlotte Hornets head scout at the time said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made. 48 Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles. However on June 30 Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9 1996 when the leagues off-season moratorium ended. 49 Since Bryant was still 17 at the time his parents had to co-sign his contract with the Lakers until Bryant was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began. 50 Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling 3.5 million. 51 Los Angeles Lakers 19962016 Adjusting to the NBA 19961999 Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach California scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris . 52 Bryant scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games. 53 As a rookie in 199697 Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel . 54 At the time he was the second-youngest player ever to play in an NBA game 18 years 72 days and also became the youngest NBA starter 18 years 158 days. 55 56 Initially Bryant played limited minutes but as the season continued he began to see some more playing time. By the end of the season Bryant averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the All-Star weekend he participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest becoming the youngest dunk champion at the age of 18. 57 Bryants performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight . 58 The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5. Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist Robert Horry was ejected for fighting with Utahs Jeff Hornacek and Shaquille ONeal fouled out with 1:46 remaining in the fourth quarter. Bryant shot four air balls at the end of the game; the Jazz won 9893 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 41. 59 He first missed a game-winning two-point jump shot in the fourth quarter and then misfired three three-point field goals in overtime including two tying shots in the final minute. 60 ONeal commented that Bryant was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that. 61 In Bryants second season he received more playing time and began to show more of his abilities as a talented young guard. As a result Bryants point averages more than doubled from 7.6 to 15.4 points per game. 62 He would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers played small which would feature Bryant playing small forward alongside the guards he would usually back up. 63 Bryant was the runner-up for the NBAs Sixth Man of the Year Award 64 and through fan voting he also became the youngest NBA All-Star starter in NBA history. 65 Bryant was joined by teammates ONeal Van Exel and Jones making it the first time since 1983 that four players on the same team were selected to play in the same All-Star Game. Bryants 15.4 points per game was the highest of any non-starter in the season. 66 The 199899 season marked Bryants emergence as a premier guard in the league. With starting guards Van Exel and Jones traded Bryant started every game for the lockout-shortened 50-game season. 67 During the season he signed a six-year contract extension worth 70 million. 66 This kept Bryant with the Lakers until the end of the 200304 season. Even at an early stage of his career sportswriters were comparing Bryants skills to those of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson . 50 68 69 However the playoff results were no better as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals. 70 Three-peat 19992002 Bryant in December 1999 Bryants fortunes improved when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999. 71 After years of steady improvement Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league earning appearances in the leagues All-NBA 72 All-Star and All-Defensive teams. 73 The Lakers became championship contenders behind the center-guard combination of Bryant and ONeal. Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls ; this offense would help both Bryant and ONeal rise to the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won consecutively in 2000 2001 and 2002 further cementing this view. 74 Bryant was sidelined for six weeks prior to the start of the 19992000 season due to a hand injury that he had incurred during a preseason game against the Washington Wizards . 75 When Bryant was back and playing over 38 minutes a game he had an increase in all statistical categories during the 19992000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of ONeal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with ONeal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All-NBA Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career the youngest player to receive All-Defensive honors. 76 While playing second fiddle to ONeal in the playoffs Bryant had some clutch performances including a 25-point 11-rebound seven-assist four-block game in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers . 77 He also threw an alley-oop pass to ONeal to clinch the game and the series. In the 2000 Finals against the Indiana Pacers Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers Jalen Rose s foot. Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally. 78 79 Bryant did not return to the game and he also missed Game 3 due to the injury. In Game 4 Bryant scored 22 points in the second half and led the team to an overtime victory as ONeal fouled out of the game. Bryant scored the winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120118. 80 With a 116111 victory in Game 6 the Lakers won their first championship since 1988 . 81 Statistically the 200001 season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year but he averaged six more points per game 28.5. It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and ONeal began to surface. 82 Once again Bryant led the team in assists with five per game. However the Lakers only won 56 games an 11-game drop-off from the previous year. The team responded by going 151 in the playoffs . They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. In the semifinals round the Lakers swept the Sacramento Kings . In Game 4 against the Kings Bryant recorded 48 points 16 rebounds and three assists in a 119113 series-clinching victory. 83 They swept the San Antonio Spurs in the Conference Finals to advance to the Finals before losing their first game against the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime. They would go on to win the next four games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points 7.3 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs teammate ONeal declared Bryant the best player in the league. 38 Bryant ended up making the All-NBA Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. He was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the third year in a row no game in 1999. In the 200102 season Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. On January 14 2002 Bryant recorded a then career-high 56 points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 12081 victory over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies . 84 He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points 5.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game. Bryant also had a career-high 46.9 shooting and once again led his team in assists. Bryant claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were going to cut your hearts out. 85 86 While making the All-NBA Defensive Team again Bryant was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second in the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento Kings . Bryant was suspended for one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers after the Lakers March 1 2002 victory over the Pacers. 87 88 The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the previous year. While they swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 41 in the first two rounds of the playoffs the Lakers did not have home-court advantage against the Sacramento Kings . The series would stretch to seven games the first time this had happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the 2002 Finals against the New Jersey Nets Bryant averaged 26.8 points 51.4 shooting 5.8 rebounds 5.3 assists per game which included scoring a quarter of the teams points. 89 At age 23 he became the youngest player to win three championships. 89 Bryants play was notable and praised for his performance in the fourth quarter of games specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs. 89 90 This cemented Bryants reputation as a clutch player. Coming up short 20022004 Bryant during the 2005 preseason In the first game of the 200203 season Bryant recorded 27 points 10 rebounds five assists and four steals in an 8782 loss to the visiting Spurs. 91 On November 1 he recorded a triple-double of 33 points 15 rebounds and 12 assists in a 10893 victory over the Clippers. 92 Bryant also set an NBA record for three-pointers in a game on January 7 2003 when he made 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics . 93 He averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. Bryant also averaged 6.9 rebounds 5.9 assists and 2.2 steals per game all career-highs to that point. 9 He was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams 9 and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 5032 in the regular season the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semifinals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs . 94 The following season the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All-Stars Karl Malone and Gary Payton to make another push at the NBA championship. 95 Bryant was arrested for sexual assault before the season began. 96 This caused him to miss some games due to court appearances or attend court earlier in the day and travel to play games later on the same day. 97 In the final game of the regular season the Lakers played the Portland Trail Blazers . Bryant made two buzzer-beaters to win the game and the Pacific Division title. At the end of the fourth quarter Bryant made a three-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to send it into overtime. 98 The game eventually went to a second overtime in which Bryant made another three-pointer as time expired to narrowly lift the Lakers past the Blazers 105104. 98 With a starting lineup of ONeal Malone Payton and Bryant the Lakers were able to reach the 2004 Finals . 99 However they were upset in five games by the Detroit Pistons who won their first championship since 1990 . 100 In that series Bryant averaged 22.6 points per game and 4.4 assists while shooting 35.1 from the field. 101 Jacksons contract as coach was not renewed and Rudy Tomjanovich took over. 102 ONeal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom Caron Butler and Brian Grant . 103 The following day Bryant declined a six-year 100 million offer to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers and re-signed with the Lakers on a seven-year 136.4 million contract. 104 105 Scoring records and playoff upsets 20042007 Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 200405 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul . The book detailed the events of the Lakers tumultuous 200304 season and has several criticisms of Bryant. In the book Jackson called Bryant un-coachable. 106 Midway through the season Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion. 107 Without him stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen . 108 Bryant was the leagues second-leading scorer at 27.6 points per game but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast and the Lakers went 3448 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. 109 The year signified a drop in his overall status in the NBA as Bryant did not make the NBA All-Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All-NBA Third Team. 110 During the season Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and Ray Allen . 111 112 The 200506 season marked a crossroads in Bryants basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant Jackson returned to coach the Lakers. 113 Bryant endorsed the move and by all appearances they worked well together the second time around leading the Lakers back into the playoffs . Bryants individual scoring accomplishments resulted in the finest statistical season of his career. On December 20 2005 Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks . Entering the fourth quarter he had personally outscored the entire Mavericks team 6261 the only time a player has done this through three quarters since the introduction of the shot clock . 114 When the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16 2006 Bryant and Shaquille ONeal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game signifying a change in the feud that had festered between them. 115 116 A month later at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game the two were seen laughing together. 117 On January 22 2006 Bryant scored a career-high 81 points in a 122104 victory over the Toronto Raptors . 118 In addition to breaking the previous franchise record of 71 set by Elgin Baylor Bryants 81-point game was the second-highest point total in NBA history surpassed only by Chamberlains 100-point game in 1962 . 119 Whereas Chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win Bryant created his own shotmostly from the outsidein a game which the Lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until the fourth quarter. 120 121 Chamberlain playing in an era when the games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful 121 122 accounted for 59 percent of his teams points in Philadelphias 169147 victory compared to Bryant scoring 66 percent of the Lakers 122 points. 123 124 That same month he also became the first player since 1964 to score 45 points or more in four consecutive games joining Chamberlain and Baylor as the only players to do so. 125 For the month of January Bryant averaged 43.4 points per game 126 the eighth highest single month scoring average in NBA history and highest for any player other than Chamberlain. 127 By the end of the 200506 season Bryant set Lakers single-season franchise records for most 40-point games 27 and most points scored 2 832. 128 He won the leagues scoring title for the first time by averaging 35.4 points per game becoming just the fifth player in league history to average at least 35 in a season . b Bryant finished in fourth place in the voting for the 2006 NBA Most Valuable Player Award but received 22 first place votessecond only to winner Steve Nash . 131 Later in the season it was reported that Bryant would change his jersey number from 8 to 24 at the start of the 200607 season . Bryants first high-school number was 24 before he switched to 33. 132 133 After the Lakers season ended Bryant said on TNT that he wanted 24 as a rookie but it was unavailable as it was worn by George McCloud as was 33 retired with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar . Bryant wore 143 at the Adidas ABCD camp and chose 8 by adding those numbers. 133 In the first round of the playoffs the Lakers played well enough to reach a 31 series lead over the Phoenix Suns culminating with Bryants overtime-forcing and game-winning shots in Game 4. They came within six seconds of eliminating the second-seeded Suns in Game 6 but the Lakers lost that game 126118 in overtime. 134 Despite Bryants 27.9 points per game in the series the Lakers broke down and ultimately fell to the Suns in seven games. 134 After scoring 50 points on 20 of 35 shooting in the Game 6 loss Bryant was criticized for only taking three shots in the second half of the 12190 Game 7 loss to Phoenix. 135 136 Bryant driving towards the basket in 2007 During the 200607 season Bryant was selected to his ninth All-Star Game appearance and on February 18 he logged 31 points six assists and six steals earning his second career All-Star Game MVP trophy. 137 Over the course of the season Bryant became involved in a number of on-court incidents.

When his shot is off Kobe will pound away relentlessly until his luck turns. 351 According to Bryant I would go 0 for 30 before I would go 0 for 9; 0 for 9 means you beat yourself you psyched yourself out of the game. 120 In addition to his abilities on offense Bryant also established himself as a standout defensive player. 352 Bryant rarely drew charges when he played defense which he believed spared his body and contributed to his longevity. 353 However some critics have suggested that Bryants defensive accolades in his later years were based more on his reputation than his actual play. 354 355 356 Bryant was also lauded for his relentless work ethic dubbed the Mamba mentality. 357 358 Throughout his first 17 seasons Bryants body was resilient 287 and he exhibited a high pain threshold while often playing through injuries. 359 360 A fierce competitor Bryant made opponents and teammates alike the objects of his scorn. 361 362 Many players have considered him difficult to play with because of his high level of commitment and performance. 363 364 365 According to sportswriter Mark Heisler of Forbes circa 20042007 Kobe was the most alienated superstar the NBA had ever seen. 366 After the departure of Shaquille ONeal he led the Lakers to two NBA championships; during this period Bryant became more of a mentor to his teammates than he had been earlier in his career. 363 366 Bryants longtime head coach Phil Jackson noted a big difference during his two Lakers coaching stints in Bryants demeanor towards his teammates. If Bryant talked to teammates in his earlier years it was usually give me the damn ball but during the latter period Bryant embraced the team and his teammates calling them up when we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner. It was as if the other players were now his partners not his personal spear-carriers. 367 NBA career statistics Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG Field goal percentage 3P 3-point field goal percentage FT Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high Won an NBA championship Led the league Regular season Year Team GP GS MPG FG 3P FT RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 199697 L.A.
