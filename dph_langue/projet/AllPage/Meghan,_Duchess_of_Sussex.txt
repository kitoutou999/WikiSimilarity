Media editor Tina Brown commented in relation to the visit they are enormously appealing to the public and very good at public engagement. 263 Privacy and the media Court cases Associated Newspapers Limited In November 2016 the MailOnline was criticized for running an article on Markles family background titled Almost Straight Outta Compton which triggered a response from Prince Harrys Communications Secretary. 15 In October 2019 Meghan filed a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers Limited ANL the publisher of The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over the publication of a letter she had sent to her father. 264 265 Thomas Markle Sr. had provided the publisher with excerpts of the letter after five of his daughters friends including Abigail Spencer 266 referenced it in a People article. 4 267 268 She subsequently received support from more than 70 female MPs from different parties who in an open letter condemned the use of outdated colonial undertones against her in some national media outlets. 269 In May 2020 the court dismissed claims of the tabloids alleged dishonesty and malice as they were deemed either vague or irrelevant to the case. 270 In February 2021 the High Court of Justice found in a summary judgment that ANLs Mail on Sunday had invaded Meghans privacy by publishing the letter 271 and she won her claim for misuse of private information and copyright infringement in May 2021. 272 She was given a 450 000 down payment on her 1.5 million legal fees as an interim payment and pursuant to copyright law her legal team asked for a front-page statement by The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline to acknowledge her legal victory. 273 The Court of Appeal granted ANL permission to appeal against the ruling. 274 The appeal was subsequently launched by ANL in November 2021. 275 Meghan and Harrys former communications secretary Jason Knaufwho had previously denied co-authoring the letter with Meghan 276 gave a statement to the court of appeal mentioning that Meghan gave him briefing points to share with Finding Freedom s authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand and that Prince Harry welcomed the suggestion that they should conceal their involvement while they both discussed the book on a routine basis . 277 ANL had previously applied to use the book in their defense. 278 279 Knauf also revealed that Meghan wondered whether she should refer to her father as daddy in the letter as she believed in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstrings . 277 Meghan subsequently apologized to the court for not remembering the emails earlier adding that the extent of the information Knauf shared with the books authors was unknown to her. 280 She also stated in her witness statement that she was unable to retrieve any text messages with Mr Knauf due to an automatic deletion system that had been installed on her devices in 2016 for security reasons. 281 In December 2021 three senior appeal judges upheld the judgement of the High Court against ANL prompting Meghan to call for reform of the tabloid industry. 282 In the same month ANLs The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline published a front-page statement on Boxing Day acknowledging Meghans victory adding that there had been an agreement on financial remedies . 283 In addition to covering a portion of Meghans legal costs the outlet agreed to pay her 1 in damages for invading her privacy and a confidential sum for infringing her copyright. 284 They were also banned from naming Meghans friends who had spoken to People magazine about the letter in 2018. 284 Other cases and complaints In November 2016 The Sun ran the headline Harry girls on Pornhub . 55 The outlet denied any smear after it was revealed that the clips were illegally uploaded scenes from the TV series Suits and not pornographic material. 55 They subsequently apologized via an official statement in February 2017. 285 In February 2018 a letter containing white powder and a racist note addressing Markle was sent to St Jamess Palace triggering counter-terrorism and hate crime investigations by Scotland Yard . 286 Meghan and Harry obtained a formal apology in May 2019 from Splash News for privacy invasion at their Cotswolds residence. 287 288 In December 2019 PA Media retracted the publishing of a Christmas card photograph of Meghan Harry and their son Archie. The agency said that the photo was retracted because they had been advised that the photograph was not representative of the Christmas card sent by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex . 289 The couple had a legal warning issued to the press in general in January 2020 after the publication of paparazzi photographs. 290 In March 2020 the couple took Splash UK to court after Meghan and her son were photographed without permission in Canada during a private family outing . The case was settled later that year with Splash UK agreeing to no longer take unauthorized photos of the family. 291 The Duke and Duchess announced in April that they would no longer cooperate with the Daily Mail The Sun Daily Mirror and Daily Express . 292 They won an apology in October from American news agency X17 for taking photographs of their son at their home using drones . 293 In March 2021 ITV News reported Meghan had complained directly to ITV s CEO about Piers Morgan s comments on mental health following her interview with Oprah Winfrey. 294 Ofcom received over 57 000 complaints about the program including one from the Duchess of Sussex. 295 296 In the same month it was reported that an American private investigator unlawfully handed over personal details about Meghan to The Sun including her Social Security number cell phone number and address when she first started dating Prince Harry in 2016. Meghan and her husband condemned the predatory practices of the British tabloids while The Sun stated that the investigator was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully and they did not use the information he provided for any unlawful practice . 297 In July 2021 Meghan filed legal complaints against The Times for two separate articles with the first one covering an unproven allegation from Robert Lacey s book that she had left an engagement in Fiji for not being appointed by UN Women as a goodwill ambassador and the second one claiming that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had refused to talk to Prince Harry after Prince Philips funeral due to fears of a potential leak. 298 299 In January 2022 the couple jointly filed a legal complaint against The Times for an article reporting on Archewell raising less than 50 000 in 2020. 300 In the same month she complained to the BBC regarding their five-part podcast Harry Meghan and the Media in which the presenter Amol Rajan stated that Meghan had apologized for misleading the Court of Appeal in her case against the Mail on Sunday . 301 302 The BBC responded by issuing a statement on its corrections and clarifications website to emphasize that she had apologized to the court for not remembering email exchanges . 302 In March 2022 Meghans half-sister Samantha Markle filed a defamation lawsuit against her in Florida accusing her of lying in the Oprah interview and disseminating false statements via her communications secretary for the book Finding Freedom and sought damages in excess of 75 000. 303 304 In June 2022 Meghans initial motion to dismiss the case was rejected by a judge following amendments made by Samantha in her complaint. 305 She filed a second motion in the same month. 305 306 In addition to applying for the case to be dismissed Meghans lawyer also applied for the discovery process to be delayed pending the outcome of the dismissal application. 307 A Florida judge later denied the application to halt the discovery process 308 but dismissed the lawsuit in March 2023. 309 In April 2023 Samantha refiled the lawsuit with another amended complaint that covered statements made by Meghan in her Netflix docuseries as well. 310 The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice in March 2024 after a judge ruled that the claimant was unable to provide evidence of defamation. 311 Samantha later appealed the decision. 312 Between December 2022 and January 2023 more than 25 000 complaints were submitted to the Independent Press Standards Organisation IPSO about a column by Jeremy Clarkson in The Sun 313 in which he stated that he hated Meghan on a cellular level and dreamed of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant Shame! and throw lumps of excrement at her. 314 On December 20 2022 Conservative MP Caroline Nokes wrote to The Sun s editor Victoria Newton calling for action to be taken against Clarkson. The letter was signed by more than 60 cross-party MPs. 315 On December 23 The Sun issued an apology stating columnists opinions are their own but they regret the publication of this article and are sincerely sorry . 316 On the following day a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex described the apology as nothing more than a PR stunt . 317 Clarkson said his column was a reference to a scene from the television series Game of Thrones and he later revealed that he had emailed Meghan and Harry on Christmas Day 2022 to apologise. 313 318 A spokesperson for the couple said Clarkson wrote solely to Harry and the article was not an isolated incident. 313 In February 2023 IPSO announced that it was launching an investigation about the article. 319 In June 2023 IPSO concluded that the column was sexist and contained a pejorative and prejudicial reference to Meghans sex but it rejected complaints that the piece raised an issue of fact or was meant to harass her or included discriminatory references on the grounds of race. 320 Bullying allegations and Oprah interview In 2021 shortly before Meghan and Harry were due to be interviewed by Oprah Winfrey Valentine Low reported in The Times that Meghans former communications secretary Jason Knauf complained in October 2018 that her conduct at Kensington Palace had caused two personal assistants to quit and had undermined the confidence of a third employee 321 prompting an investigation by Buckingham Palace into the bullying allegations. 322 323 The palace hired an external law firm to examine the claims with ten aides reported to have cooperated with the review. 324 325 Criticism of Meghan for twice wearing earrings gifted from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2018 after he was accused of complicity in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi appeared at the same time. 326 321 327 Her representatives denied her awareness of the accusations against Mohammed bin Salman and said The Times were being used by Buckingham Palace for a smear campaign against her. 328 321 The television special Oprah with Meghan and Harry was broadcast on CBS on March 7 2021. 329 Meghan spoke about her personal and royal life and public pressure. She claimed to have been contemplating suicide during her time as a working royal and complained of a lack of protection for her and her son while being part of the royal institution. 330 There was a wide and polarized reaction to the interview. 331 In an updated epilogue for the couples unauthorized biography Finding Freedom by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand the authors claimed that two of the individuals mentioned in Knaufs email asked for any allegations made to HR about their experiences with Meghan to be rescinded . 332 Speaking on behalf of the Duchess in a BBC documentary Jenny Afia a lawyer who represented Meghan in her case against ANL stated that the bullying allegations were just not true . 333 In June 2022 The Times reported that the results from the inquiry made Buckingham Palace modify some of the policies and procedures in its HR department but the report would not be published to ensure the privacy of those who took part in it. 334 In September 2024 The Hollywood Reporter reported on complaints raised by American staff members about Meghans behavior. Her spokesperson declined to comment. 335 On Twitter and other platforms In March 2019 European consulting firm 89up reported on their discovery of 1 103 highly connected Twitter accounts with more than two and a half million tweets in favor of Meghan most of which appeared to be bots carrying out coordinated attacks on royal correspondents who had reported negatively on her. 336 337 In the same year CNN had reported on research by Hope not Hate stating that out of 5 200 abusive tweets directed at Meghan in January and February 2019 3 600 came from a small group of trolls . 336 In March 2019 the royal family introduced new rules for followers commenting on its official social media accounts in response to the online abuse aimed at Meghan and her sister-in-law Catherine. 338 In October 2021 Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114 000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as a result of which they found 83 accounts with a combined number of 187 631 followers that were possibly responsible for approximately 70 of the negative content posted about the couple. 339 340 341 The report prompted an investigation by Twitter. 339 The company stated that it found no evidence of widespread coordination between the accounts and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitters conduct policy. 339 Bot Sentinel released three more reports in the following months arguing that the accounts were part of a bot network and a similar network could be found on YouTube. 342 343 344 In January 2022 the BBC named Meghan and Harry among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits advertisements and bitcoin -related investment schemes. 345 Among theories widespread on social media including Twitter and YouTube were unfounded assertions that Meghan had faked her pregnancies instead using surrogate mothers or that her children do not exist at all. 346 347 348 Meghans half-sister Samantha was reported to have run multiple Twitter accounts that targeted Meghan. 349 350 Titles styles and arms Meghan became a princess of the United Kingdom upon her marriage to Prince Harry entitled to the style of Royal Highness . 351 After her marriage she was styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex . She also holds the titles of Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel . 352 She is the first person to hold the title Duchess of Sussex . 353 354 Following the Duke and Duchesss decision to step back from royal duties in 2020 the couple agreed not to use the style of Royal Highness in practice but they are still referred to as HisHer Royal Highness in legal settings. 355 356 357 358 During Meghans trip to Nigeria in May 2024 Igwe Alfred Achebe the Obi of Onitsha and Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi the Oluwo of Iwo gave her the chieftaincy titles Ada Mazi transl. the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace and Adetokunbo transl. royalty from across the seas . 129 Coat of arms of the Duchess of Sussex Notes The Duchess bears the arms of her husband impaled with her own.
