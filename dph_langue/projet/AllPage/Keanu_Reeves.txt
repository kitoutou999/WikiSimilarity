Reeves last met his father on the Hawaiian island of Kauai when he was 13. 14 After his parents divorced in 1966 his mother moved the family to Sydney 14 15 and then to New York City where she married Paul Aaron a Broadway and Hollywood director in 1970. 14 The couple moved to Toronto and divorced in 1971.

Reeves and his sisters grew up primarily in the Yorkville neighbourhood of Toronto with a nanny caring for them frequently. 14 17 Reeves watched British comedy shows such as The Two Ronnies and his mother imparted English manners that he has maintained into adulthood. 18 Because of his grandmothers Chinese ethnicity Reeves grew up with Chinese art furniture and cuisine . 19 Describing himself as a private kid 20 Reeves attended four different high schools including the Etobicoke School of the Arts from which he was expelled. Reeves said he was expelled because he was just a little too rambunctious and shot my mouth off once too often ... I was not generally the most well-oiled machine in the school . 21 Reeves has dyslexia and has said Because I had trouble reading I wasnt a good student . 22 At De La Salle College he was a successful ice hockey goalkeeper. Reeves had aspirations to play for the Canadian Olympic team and was once considered an OHL prospect but his hockey career ended due to injury. 23 At the age of 15 he decided he wanted to become an actor. 24 After leaving De La Salle College he attended Avondale Secondary Alternative School which allowed him to get an education while working as an actor. Reeves dropped out of high school when he was 17. 25 He obtained a green card through his American stepfather and moved to Los Angeles three years later. 14 Reeves holds only Canadian citizenship. 7 8 Career Main article: Keanu Reeves filmography 19841990: Early work Reeves in 1986 In 1984 Reeves was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC youth television program Going Great . 26 That same year he made his acting debut in an episode of the television series called Hangin In . 27 In 1985 he played Mercutio in a stage production of Romeo and Juliet at the Leah Posluns Theatre in North York Ontario. 28 29 He made further appearances on stage including Brad Fraser s cult hit Wolfboy in Toronto. He also appeared in a Coca-Cola commercial in 1983 30 and in the National Film Board of Canada NFB coming-of-age short film One Step Away . 31 Reeves later said that when he was looking for work in the mid-1980s his agents advised him to go by a different name because his first name was too ethnic . He briefly initialized his first and middle name and attended auditions as K. C. or Casey Reeves before reverting to Keanu. 32 Reeves made a foray into television films in 1986 including NBC s Babes in Toyland Act of Vengeance and Brotherhood of Justice . He made his first motion picture appearances in Peter Markle s Youngblood 1986 in which he played a goalkeeper and in the low-budget romantic drama Flying . He was cast as Matt in Rivers Edge a crime drama about a group of high school friends dealing with a murder case loosely based on the 1981 murder of Marcy Renee Conrad . The film premiered in 1986 at the Toronto International Film Festival to a largely positive response. Janet Maslin of The New York Times describes the performances of the young cast as natural and credible with Reeves being described as affecting and sympathetic . 33 Towards the end of the 1980s Reeves starred in several dramas aimed at teen audiences including as the lead in The Night Before 1988 a comedy starring opposite Lori Loughlin The Prince of Pennsylvania 1988 and Permanent Record 1988. Although the latter received mixed reviews Variety magazine praised Reevess performance which opens up nicely as the drama progresses . 34 His other acting efforts included a supporting role in Dangerous Liaisons 1988 which earned seven nominations at the 61st Academy Awards winning three: Best Adapted Screenplay Best Costume Design and Best Production Design . 35 This was followed by Bill Teds Excellent Adventure 1989 in which he portrays a slacker who travels through time with a friend portrayed by Alex Winter to assemble historical figures for a school presentation. The film was generally well received by critics and grossed 40.5 million at the worldwide box office. 36 Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 79 approval rating with the critical consensus: Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just charming goofy and silly enough to make this fluffy time-travel Adventure work . 37 In 1989 Reeves starred in the comedy-drama Parenthood directed by Ron Howard . Nick Hilditch of the BBC gave the film three out of five stars calling it a feelgood movie with an extensive and entertaining ensemble cast . 38 In 1990 Reeves gave two acting performances; he portrayed an incompetent hitman in the black comedy I Love You to Death and played Martin a radio station employee in the comedy Tune in Tomorrow . He also appeared in Paula Abdul s music video for Rush Rush which featured a Rebel Without a Cause motif with him in the James Dean role. 39 19911994: Breakthrough with mature roles In 1991 Reeves starred in Bill Teds Bogus Journey a sequel to Bill Teds Excellent Adventure with his co-star Alex Winter . Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the sequel was more imaginative more opulent wilder and freer more excitingly visualized praising the actors for their fuller performances. 40 Film critic Roger Ebert thought it was a riot of visual invention and weird humour that works on its chosen sub-moronic level ... Its the kind of movie where you start out snickering in spite of yourself and end up actually admiring the originality that went into creating this hallucinatory slapstick . 41 The rest of 1991 marked a significant transition for Reevess career as he undertook adult roles. Co-starring with River Phoenix as a street hustler in the adventure My Own Private Idaho the characters embark on a journey of personal discovery. The story was written by Gus Van Sant and is loosely based on Shakespeare s Henry IV Part 1 Henry IV Part 2 and Henry V . The film premiered at the 48th Venice International Film Festival 42 followed by a theatrical release in the United States on September 29 1991. The film earned 6.4 million at the box office. 43 My Own Private Idaho was positively received with Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly describing the film as a postmodern road movie with a mood of free-floating trance-like despair ... a rich audacious experience . 44 The New York Times complimented Reeves and Phoenix for their insightful performances. 45 Reeves starred alongside Patrick Swayze Lori Petty and Gary Busey in the action thriller Point Break 1991 directed by Kathryn Bigelow . He plays an undercover FBI agent tasked with investigating the identities of a group of bank robbers. To prepare for the film Reeves and his co-stars took surfing lessons with professional surfer Dennis Jarvis in Hawaii; Reeves had never surfed before. 46 Upon its release Point Break was generally well-received and a commercial success earning 83.5 million at the box office. 47 Reevess performance was praised by The New York Times for considerable discipline and range adding He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanour that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles . 48 Writing for The Washington Post Hal Hinson called Reeves the perfect choice and praised the surfing scenes but opined that the filmmakers have their characters make the most ludicrously illogical choices imaginable . 49 At the 1992 MTV Movie Awards Reeves won the Most Desirable Male award. 50 In 1991 Reeves developed an interest in a music career; he formed an alternative rock band called Dogstar consisting of members Robert Mailhouse Gregg Miller and Bret Domrose. Reeves played the bass guitar. A year later he played Jonathan Harker in Francis Ford Coppola s Gothic horror Bram Stokers Dracula based on Stokers 1897 novel Dracula . Starring alongside Gary Oldman Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins the film was critically and commercially successful. It grossed 215.8 million worldwide. 51 For his role Reeves was required to speak with an English accent which drew some ridicule; Overly posh and entirely ridiculous Reevess performance is as painful as it is hilarious wrote Limara Salt of Virgin Media . 52 In a retrospective interview in 2015 director Coppola said Reeves tried so hard ... He wanted to do it perfectly and in trying to do it perfectly it came off as stilted . 53 Bram Stokers Dracula was nominated for four Academy Awards winning three in Best Costume Design Best Sound Editing and Best Makeup . 54 The film also received four nominations at the British Academy Film Awards . 55 In 1993 he had a role in Much Ado About Nothing based on Shakespeare s play of the same name . The film received positive reviews 56 although Reeves was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor . 57 The New Republic magazine thought his casting was unfortunate because of his amateur performance. 58 In that same year he starred in two more drama films Even Cowgirls Get the Blues and Little Buddha both of which garnered a mixed-to-negative reception. 59 60 The Independent critic gave Little Buddha a mixed review but opined that Reevess part as a prince was credible . 61 The film also left an impression on Reeves; he later said When I played this innocent prince who starts to suspect something when he has the first revelations about old age sickness and death it hit me. ... That lesson has never left me. 62 He starred in the action thriller Speed 1994 alongside Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper . He plays police officer Jack Traven who must prevent a bus from exploding by keeping its speed above 50 mph. Speed was the directorial debut of Dutch director Jan de Bont . Several actors were considered for the lead role but Reeves was chosen because Bont was impressed with his Point Break performance. 63 To look the part Reeves shaved all his hair off and spent two months in the gym to gain muscle mass. During production Reevess friend River Phoenix and co-star in My Own Private Idaho died resulting in adjustments to the filming schedule to allow him to mourn. 63 Speed was released on June 10 to a critically acclaimed response. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune lauded Reeves calling him absolutely charismatic ... giving a performance juiced with joy as he jumps through elevator shafts ... and atop a subway train . 64 David Ansen writing for Newsweek summarized Speed as Relentless without being overbearing this is one likely blockbuster that doesnt feel too big for its britches. Its a friendly juggernaut . 65 The film grossed 350 million from a 30 million budget and won two Academy Awards in 1995 Best Sound Editing and Best Sound . 66 67 19951998: Career fluctuations I do love it Shakespeare. Its like this kind of code that once you start to inhabit it with breath and sound and feeling and thought it is the most powerful and consuming and freeing at the same time. Just literally elemental in sound consonants and vowels. What I found out in doing it Hamlet was that it brought up for me all the anger that was inside me for my mother. I mean it surprised me just what was there and I hadnt seen that before. Reeves on his Hamlet performance 68 Reevess next leading role came in the 1995 cyberpunk action thriller Johnny Mnemonic directed by artist Robert Longo and based on the 1981 story of the same name by William Gibson . Set in 2021 it is about a man who has a cybernetic brain implant and must deliver a data package before he dies or is killed by the yakuza . The film received mainly negative reviews and critics felt Reeves was woefully miscast . 69 Roger Ebert opined that the film is one of the great goofy gestures of recent cinema a movie that doesnt deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis but has a kind of idiotic grandeur that makes you almost forgive it. 70 As part of the film studios marketing efforts a CD-ROM video game was also released. 71 He next appeared in the romantic drama A Walk in the Clouds 1995 which also garnered mixed-to-negative reviews. 72 Reeves plays a young soldier returning home from World War II trying to settle down with a woman he married impulsively just before he enlisted. Film critic Mick LaSalle opined that A Walk in the Clouds is for the most part a beautiful well-acted and emotionally rich picture whereas Hal Hinson from The Washington Post said The film has the syrupy Kodak magic-moment look of a Bo Derek movie and pretty much the same level of substance . 73 74 Besides film work Reeves retreated briefly to the theatre playing Prince Hamlet in a 1995 Manitoba Theatre Centre production of Hamlet in Winnipeg Manitoba. 75 The Sunday Times critic Roger Lewis believed his performance writing he quite embodied the innocence the splendid fury the animal grace of the leaps and bounds the emotional violence that form the Prince of Denmark ... He is one of the top three Hamlets I have seen for a simple reason: he is Hamlet . 76 Reeves was soon drawn to science fiction roles appearing in Chain Reaction 1996 with co-stars Morgan Freeman Rachel Weisz Fred Ward Kevin Dunn and Brian Cox . He plays a researcher of a green energy project who has to go on the run when he is framed for murder. Chain Reaction was not a critical success and gained mostly a negative reaction; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating of 16 and described it as a man-on-the-run thriller that mostly sticks to generic formula . 77 Reevess film choices after Chain Reaction were also critical disappointments. He starred in the independent crime comedy Feeling Minnesota 1996 with Vincent DOnofrio and Cameron Diaz which was described as shoddily assembled and fundamentally miscast by Rotten Tomatoes. 78 In that year he turned down an offer to star in Speed 2: Cruise Control despite being offered a salary of 12 million. 79 According to Reeves this decision caused 20th Century Fox to sever ties with him for a decade. 80 Instead Reeves toured with his band Dogstar and appeared in the drama The Last Time I Committed Suicide 1997 based on a 1950 letter written by Neal Cassady to Jack Kerouac . Reevess performance gained mixed reviews; Paul Tatara of CNN called him void of talent ... here he is again reciting his lines as if theyre non-related words strung together as a memory exercise 81 whereas Empire magazine thought Reeves gives the nearest thing to a performance in his career as the enthusiastic feckless drunk . 82 He starred in the 1997 supernatural horror The Devils Advocate alongside Al Pacino and Charlize Theron ; Reeves agreed to a pay cut of several million dollars so that the film studio could afford to hire Pacino. 83 Based on Andrew Neiderman s novel of the same name the feature is about a successful young lawyer invited to New York City to work for a major firm who discovers the owner of the firm is a devil . The Devils Advocate attracted positive reviews from critics. 84 Film critic James Berardinelli called the film highly enjoyable and wrote There are times when Reeves lacks the subtlety that would have made this a more multi-layered portrayal but its nevertheless a solid job . 85 19992004: Resurgence with The Matrix franchise and comedies Reeves promoting The Day the Earth Stood Still in Mexico 2008 In 1999 Reeves starred in the critically acclaimed science fiction film The Matrix the first installment in what would become The Matrix franchise . 86 Reeves portrays computer programmer Thomas Anderson a hacker using the alias Neo who discovers humanity is trapped inside a simulated reality created by intelligent machines . To prepare for the film which was written and directed by the Wachowskis Reeves had read Kevin Kelly s Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines Social Systems and the Economic World and Dylan Evans s ideas on evolutionary psychology . The principal cast underwent months of intense training with martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping to prepare for the fight scenes. 87 The Matrix proved to be a box office success; several critics considered it to be one of the best science fiction films of all time . 88 89 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt it was a wildly cinematic futuristic thriller that is determined to overpower the imagination despite perceiving weaknesses in the films dialogue. 90 Janet Maslin of The New York Times credited Reeves for being a strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero and thought the martial arts stunts were the films strongest feature. 91 The Matrix received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing Best Sound Editing Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. 92 After the success of The Matrix Reeves avoided another blockbuster in favour of a lighthearted sports comedy The Replacements 2000. He agreed to a pay cut to enable Gene Hackman to co-star in the film. 83 Against his wishes Reeves starred in the thriller The Watcher 2000 playing a serial killer who stalks a retired FBI agent. He said that a friend forged his signature on a contract which he could not prove; he appeared in the film to avoid legal action. 93 Upon its release the film was critically panned. 94 That year he had a supporting role in another thriller Sam Raimi s The Gift a story about a woman played by Cate Blanchett with extrasensory perception asked to help find a young woman who disappeared. The film grossed 44 million worldwide. 95 Film critic Paul Clinton of CNN thought the film was fairly compelling saying of Reevess acting: Raimi managed to get a performance out of Reeves that only occasionally sounds like hes reading his lines from the back of a cereal box. 96 In 2001 Reeves continued to explore and accept roles in a diverse range of genres. The first was a romantic drama Sweet November a remake of the 1968 film of the same name . This was his second collaboration with Charlize Theron; the film was met with a generally negative reception. 97 Desson Thompson of The Washington Post criticized it for its syrupy cliches greeting-card wisdom and over-the-top tragicomedy but commended Reeves for his likability factor in every performance he gives. 98 Hardball 2001 marked Reevess attempt in another sports comedy. Directed by Brian Robbins it is based on the book Hardball: A Season in the Projects by Daniel Coyle. Reeves plays Conor ONeill a troubled young man who agrees to coach a Little League team from the Cabrini Green housing project in Chicago as a condition of obtaining a loan. Film critic Roger Ebert noted the films desire to tackle difficult subjects and baseball coaching but felt it lacked depth and Reevess performance was glum and distant . 99 By 2002 his professional music career had come to an end when Dogstar disbanded. The band had released two albums during their decade together; Our Little Visionary in 1996 and Happy Ending in 2000. 100 Sometime afterwards Reeves performed in the band Becky for a year founded by Dogstar band-mate Rob Mailhouse but quit in 2005 citing a lack of interest in a serious music career. 101 102 After being absent from the screen in 2002 Reeves returned to The Matrix sequels in 2003 with The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions released in May and November respectively. Principal photography for both films was completed back-to-back primarily at Fox Studios in Australia. 103 The Matrix Reloaded garnered mostly favourable reviews; John Powers of LA Weekly praised the dazzling pyrotechnics but was critical of certain machine-like action scenes. Of Reevess acting Powers thought it was somewhat wooden but felt he has the ability to exude a charmed aura . 104 Andrew Walker writing for the Evening Standard praised the cinematography visually it gives full value as a virtuoso workout for your senses but he was less taken by the films dime-store philosophy . 105 The film grossed 739 million worldwide. 106 The Matrix Revolutions the third installment was met with mixed reception. According to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the consensus was that characters and ideas take a back seat to the special effects . 107 Paul Clinton writing for CNN praised the special effects but felt Reevess character was unfocused. 108 In contrast the San Francisco Chronicle s Carla Meyer was highly critical of the special effects writing The Wachowskis computer-generated imagery goes from dazzling to deadening in action scenes that favor heavy clanking weaponry over the martial-arts moves that thrilled viewers of The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded . 109 Nevertheless the film grossed a healthy 427 million worldwide although less than the two previous films. 110 Somethings Gotta Give a romantic comedy was Reevess last release of 2003. He co-starred with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton and played Dr. Julian Mercer in the film. Somethings Gotta Give received generally favourable reviews. 111 20052013: Thrillers documentaries and directorial debut Reeves at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2009 In 2005 Reeves played the title role in Constantine an occult detective film about a man who has the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons. The film was a respectable box office hit grossing 230 million worldwide from a 100 million budget but attracted mixed-to-positive reviews. 112 The Sydney Morning Herald s critic wrote that Constantine isnt bad but it doesnt deserve any imposing adjectives. Its occasionally cheesy sometimes enjoyable intermittently scary and constantly spiked with celestial blatherskite . 113 He next appeared in Thumbsucker which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005. 114 A comedy adapted from the 1999 Walter Kirn novel of the same name the story follows a boy with a thumb-sucking problem. Reeves and the cast garnered positive critical reviews with The Washington Post describing it as a gently stirring symphony about emotional transition filled with lovely musical passages and softly nuanced performances . 115 Reeves appeared in the Richard Linklater -directed animated science fiction thriller A Scanner Darkly which premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival . 116 Reeves played Bob ArctorFred an undercover agent in a futuristic dystopia under high-tech police surveillance . Based on the novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick the film was a box office failure. 117 However the film attracted generally favourable reviews; Paul Arendt of the BBC thought the film was beautiful to watch but Reeves was outshone by his co-star Robert Downey Jr . 118 119 His next role was Alex Wyler in The Lake House 2006 a romantic drama adaptation of the South Korean film Il Mare 2000 which reunited him with Sandra Bullock. Despite its box office success 120 Mark Kermode of The Guardian was highly critical writing this syrup-drenched supernatural whimsy achieves stupidity at a genuinely international level ... The last time Bullock and Reeves were together on screen the result was Speed . This should have been entitled Stop . 121 Towards the end of 2006 he co-narrated The Great Warming with Alanis Morissette a documentary about climate change mitigation . 122 Next in 2008 Reeves collaborated with director David Ayer on the crime thriller Street Kings . He played an undercover policeman who must clear his name after the death of another officer. Released on April 11 the film grossed a moderate 66 million worldwide. 123 The films plot and Reeves performance however were met with mostly unenthusiastic reviews. Paul Byrnes of The Sydney Morning Herald stated Its full of twists and turns a dead body in every reel but its not difficult to work out whos betraying whom and thats just not good enough . 124 The Guardian opined that Reeves is fundamentally blank and uninteresting . 125 Reeves starred in another science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still a loose adaptation of the 1951 film of the same name . He portrayed Klaatu an alien sent from outer space to try to change human behaviour or eradicate humans because of their environmental impact . At the 2009 Razzie Awards the film was nominated for Worst Prequel Remake Rip-off or Sequel . 126 Many critics were unimpressed with the heavy use of special effects; The Telegraph credited Reeves ability to engage the audience but thought the cinematography was abysmal and the sub- Al-Gore environment lecture leaves you light-headed with tedium . 127 128 Tiger Chen and Reeves at the Fantastic Fest film festival 2013 Rebecca Miller s The Private Lives of Pippa Lee was Reeves sole release of 2009 which premiered at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival . 129 The romantic comedy and its ensemble received an amicable review from The Telegraph s David Gritten; Millers film is a triumph. Uniformly well acted it boasts a psychologically knowing script clearly written by a smart assertive human . 130 In 2010 he starred in another romantic comedy Henrys Crime about a man who is released from prison for a crime he did not commit but then targets the same bank with his former cellmate. The film was not a box office hit. 131 Reeves only work in 2011 was an adult picture book titled Ode to Happiness which he wrote complemented by Alexandra Grant s illustrations. 132 133 Reeves co-produced and appeared in a 2012 documentary Side by Side . He interviewed filmmakers including James Cameron Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan ; the feature investigated digital and photochemical film creation. 134 Next Reeves starred in Generation Um... 2012 an independent drama which was critically panned. 135 In 2013 Reeves starred in his own directorial debut the martial arts film Man of Tai Chi . The film has multilingual dialogue and follows a young man drawn to an underground fight club partially inspired by the life of Reeves friend Tiger Chen . Principal photography took place in China and in Hong Kong. Reeves was also assisted by Yuen Woo-ping the fight choreographer of The Matrix films. 136 Man of Tai Chi premiered at the Beijing Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival 137 138 and received praise from director John Woo . 139 A wider warm response followed suit; Bilge Ebiri of Vulture thought the fight sequences were beautifully assembled and Reeves showed restraint with the film editing to present the fighters motion sequences. 140 The Los Angeles Times wrote The brutally efficient shooting style Reeves employs to film master choreographer Yuen Woo-pings breathtaking fights ... is refreshingly grounded and old-school kinetic 141 while Dave McGinn of The Globe and Mail called the film ambitious but generic . 142 At the box office Man of Tai Chi was a commercial disappointment grossing only 5.5 million worldwide from a budget of 25 million. 143 144 Also in 2013 Reeves played Kai in the 3D fantasy 47 Ronin a Japanese fable about a group of rogue samurai . The film premiered in Japan but failed to gain traction with audiences; reviews were not positive causing Universal Pictures to reduce advertising for the film elsewhere. 47 Ronin was a box office flop and was mostly poorly received. 145 20142022: Resurgence with John Wick Reeves in 2015 After this series of commercial failures Reeves career rebounded in 2014. He played the title role in the action thriller John Wick directed by Chad Stahelski . In the first installment of the John Wick franchise Reeves plays a retired hitman seeking vengeance. He worked closely with the screenwriter to develop the story; We all agreed on the potential of the project. I love the role but you want the whole story the whole ensemble to come to life Reeves said. 146 Filmed on location in the New York City area the film was eventually released on October 24 in the United States. 147 The Hollywood Reporter was impressed by the directors confident muscular action debut and Reeves effortless performance which marked his return to the action genre. 148 Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times praised Reeves fight scenes and wrote he is always more comfortable in roles that demand cool over hot attitude over emotion . 149 John Wick proved to be a box office success grossing 86 million worldwide. 150 Next Reeves starred in a smaller-scale horror feature Knock Knock 2015 a remake of Death Game 1977 filmed 1974. Described as over-the-top destruction by the Toronto Star Reeves plays a father home alone when two young women show up and start a game of cat and mouse . 151 His other releases in 2015 were the documentaries Deep Web about crime on the dark web and Mifune: The Last Samurai about the life of a Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune famous for playing samurai characters. He narrated both films. 152 153 Reeves appeared in five film releases in 2016.
