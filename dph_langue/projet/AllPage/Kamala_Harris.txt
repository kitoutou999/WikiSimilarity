Our national security funding is specifically designed to promote American interests enhance our collective security and protect the safety of our citizens... By obstructing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding and seeking to terminate similar funding from Fiscal Year 2017 you are personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity.
