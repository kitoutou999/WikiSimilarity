Early life Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27 1982 and spent his first few years in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of Uptown New Orleans Louisiana s 17th Ward . 19 His mother a cook gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was two and his father permanently abandoned the family. When CBS interviewer Katie Couric asked why he used the name Wayne instead of his given name Carter explained that I dropped the D because Im a junior and my father is living and hes not in my life and hes never been in my life. So I dont want to be Dwayne Id rather be Wayne . Asked if his father knew of this Carter replied He knows now . 20 Carter has said that he considers his deceased stepfather Reginald Rabbit McDonald to be his real father. Carter has a tattoo dedicated to McDonald. 21 Carter was enrolled in the gifted program at Lafayette Elementary School. He later attended Eleanor McMain Secondary School for two years where he was an honor student and a member of the drama club playing the Tin Man in the schools production of The Wiz . 22 23 24 After matriculating to Marion Abramson Senior High School Carter dropped out at age 14 to focus on his musical career. 25 Carter wrote his first rap song at age eight. 26 In the summer of 1991 he met rapper and Cash Money Records co-founder Bryan Baby Williams known currently as Birdman who mentored him and encouraged his love of hip-hop; Birdman included Carter on several Cash Money tracks and he in return would often record freestyle raps on Williams answering machine. 27 In 1994 at age 12 Carter suffered a near-fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. 28 At the time he said the injury was accidental. However in September 2018 Carter claimed in interviews that it was an attempted suicide after he was told by his mother that he would have to end his rap-related associations. 29 Carter credits off-duty police officer Robert Hoobler 19562022 30 31 who he calls Uncle Bob with saving his life by insisting the dying child be driven immediately to hospital in a police car rather than waiting for an ambulance to become available. 32 Other accounts indicate that several officers played a part in deciding on and implementing that course of action. 28 Career 19941999: Career beginnings and Hot Boys After recovering from his self-inflicted gunshot wound Carter linked with Christopher Dorsey a local New Orleans rapper known as B.G. his longtime friend future Cash Money labelmate and Hot Boys bandmate. They would later form their duo the B.G.z with B.G. being named Lil Doogie and Carter being Baby D . 33 They only released one album under the group name True Story 1995. 33 In 1997 Carter and Dorsey then joined the hip-hop quartet the Hot Boys along with rappers and labelmates Juvenile and Turk .

The two eventually reconciled once again and Juvenile re-signed with Cash Money Records in 2014. 358 359 Young Buck Young Buck released a song called Off Parole featuring Tony Yayo which insulted Carter. Young Buck said that Carter could not be angry because Young Buck spoke the truth. Young Buck also said You think you got a problem with Juve and B.G.; youll have a true problem with me referring to the Cash Money-JuvenileB.G feud. 360 361 One of the reasons 50 Cent stated he was dismissing Young Buck was what he called inconsistent behavior which included appearing on stage with Carter then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit. 362 After he was dismissed Young Buck appeared in the music video My Life by The Game which featured Carter on the songs chorus. 363 As of 2009 Young Buck and Carter have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track Ups and Downs for Young Bucks Back on My Buck Shit mixtape. Pusha T Tension between Wayne and Pusha T had been going on for years beginning soon after Clipse and Birdman worked on What Happened to That Boy the latters 2002 single. In 2006 Wayne felt the Clipse song Mr. Me Too was directed at him which caused more tension between the two. 364 In 2012 after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Waynes Young Money signee Drake in several songs the speculation heightened after the release of Pusha Ts Exodus 23:1 song. Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service Twitter and later released a diss track titled Goulish . In the first verse Wayne raps Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him His head up his ass Imma have to head-butt him . 365 Pusha T called Waynes diss track horrible and said he felt it did not deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud with Wayne saying hes over it. 366 367 However in November 2012 Pusha T dissed Wayne and Birdman on a new Ludacris song titled Tell Me What They Mad For . 368 In December 2014 once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to G.O.O.D. Music which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit. 369 non-primary source needed Jay-Z In a 2009 interview with Tropical TV Birdman disputed the MTV poll that voted Jay-Z The Hottest MC in the Game stating that Lil Wayne was a better rapper and made more money. 370 In early 2011 when Jay-Z and Kanye West s single HAM was released Jay-Z took shots at Birdman saying Really you got Baby money and you aint got my ladys money! . 371 On August 24 2011 a song called Its Good by Lil Wayne featuring Drake and Jadakiss was leaked online and included Lil Wayne responding Talkin bout baby money? I gotcha baby money. Kidnap your bitch get that How much you love your lady? money . 372 373 Jadakiss later absolved himself of involvement in any brewing beef on his official Twitter feed. 374 375 Dispute with Cash Money Records On December 4 2014 just five days before Tha Carter V was due to be released Carter issued a statement saying the album would not be released on its expected release date due to his displeasure with Cash Money Records label-boss Birdman refusing to release the album although it had been completed. Carter also expressed his feelings by stating he felt both he and his creativity were being held prisoner . 137 376 Upon Sorry for the Wait 2 s release on January 20 2015 he continuously disses Birdman and Cash Money Records several times throughout the mixtape. 377 378 379 Birdman was reported to be upset with this. 380 In late January 2015 Carter sued Birdman and Cash Money Records for 51 million. 381 382 Carter and Birdman supposedly reconciled after being seen at Drake s NYE Party at Miamis Club Liv and in studio. 383 On January 27 2024 both Carter and Birdman reunited during a studio session putting an end to their nine-year quarrel. 384 Political and racial views In 2013 Carter received criticism after a video released by TMZ showed him apparently stepping on the U.S. flag. Carter later explained that It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States and that he was shooting a video for a song on his upcoming album God Bless Amerika . He says the purpose of the flag was to show that behind the American Flag was the Hoods of America . 385 In late 2016 Carter made statements critical of the Black Lives Matter movement saying I dont feel connected to a damn thing that aint got nothin to do with me. If you do you crazy as shit adding that his status as a wealthy black man who has white fans is evidence that black people are valued in the United States. 386 Discography Main articles: Lil Wayne albums discography Lil Wayne singles discography and Lil Wayne videography See also: Hot Boys discography and Young Money discography Lil Waynes general marketing logo used since 2010 Studio albums Tha Block Is Hot 1999 Lights Out 2000 500 Degreez 2002 Tha Carter 2004 Tha Carter II 2005 Tha Carter III 2008 Rebirth 2010 I Am Not a Human Being 2010 Tha Carter IV 2011 I Am Not a Human Being II 2013 Free Weezy Album 2015 Tha Carter V 2018 Funeral 2020 Tha Carter VI 2024 I Am Not a Human Being III 2024 Collaborative albums Like Father Like Son with Birdman 2006 Welcome 2 Collegrove with 2 Chainz 2023 387 Filmography Film Year Film Role Notes 2000 Baller Blockin Iceberg Shorty 2007 Whos Your Caddy?
