In 2005 the Council of Paris revealed that Cruise had lobbied French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Senate President Jean-Claude Gaudin ; they described Cruise as a militant spokesman for Scientology and barred any further dealings with him. 163 164 Controversies Criticism of psychiatry See also: Anti-psychiatry In January 2004 Cruise said I think psychiatry should be outlawed. 165 In 2005 he criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil paroxetine an antidepressant which she used to recover from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience . In response Shields argued that Cruise should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them. 166 This led to a heated argument between Cruise and Matt Lauer on NBCs Today on June 24 2005. 167 168 Medical authorities view Cruises comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. 169 From The Lancet He may be right that psychotropic drugs are overused sometimes misused; and that lifestyle changes and exercise for depression can be helpful. But he is wrong as a celebrity to add to the burden of those with a mental illness who often fear seeking or continuing treatment because of the stigma still attached to their condition. 169 Shields called Cruises comments a disservice to mothers everywhere . 170 In late August 2006 Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments. 171 Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and psychoactive drugs that are routinely prescribed for treatment. 161 It was reported that Cruises anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg . 172 Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruises presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter the doctors office was picketed by Scientologists reportedly angering Spielberg. 173 YouTube video removal Main article: Project Chanology Tom Cruise video On January 15 2008 a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube by the Anonymous -linked group Project Chanology showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him. 174 175 The Church of Scientology said the video had been pirated and edited and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology. 175 176 YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation. 177 It was subsequently reinstated on the site and as of June 2020 the video has achieved over 15 million views. 178 Purported influence In March 2004 his publicist of 14 years Pat Kingsley resigned. Cruises next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette his sister who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005. 179 DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan . 180 Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes. 181 182 failed verification Lawrence Wright s 2013 book Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief and Alex Gibney s 2015 television documentary adaptation of the same name cast a spotlight on Cruises role in Scientology. The book and the film both allege that the Scientology organization groomed romantic partners for Cruise and that Cruise used Sea Org and Rehabilitation Project Force workers as a source of free labor. 183 157 In the film Cruises former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Cruises suggestion which Cruises lawyer denies. 184 185 Cruises ex-girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi later compared the Scientology organizations auditioning of women to date Cruise and experiences with him to white slavery . 186 See also Miles Fisher American actor and notable Cruise impersonator Supercouple Tom Cruise: Unauthorized 1998 Tom Cruise: All the Worlds a Stage 2006 Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography 2008 Tom Cruise Purple References Will Tom Cruise Be the Last Real Movie Star? .
