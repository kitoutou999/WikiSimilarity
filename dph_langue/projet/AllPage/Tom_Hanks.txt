Two interviews are about the 12 part miniseries From Earth to the Moon for which Hanks was executive producer and which was nominated for 17 Emmy Awards. The last interview segment comprises anecdotes shared by Hanks about his acting career. 226 Roger Ebert wrote of actors who are not bigger than life but somehow just like lifepeople who we feel we know and understand and are comfortable with. We sense that these actors embody not our fantasies but our lives. Watching them we feel congratulated because we are watching ourselves. They reassure us that in our ordinariness we also have a kind of importance. The actors who can do that Buster Keaton Spencer Tracy James Stewart Henry Fonda Robert Duvall Gene Hackman and Tom Hanks occupy a special category... The central triumph of Tom Hanks as a movie actor is that most of the time we believe he thinks a lot like us and does more or less what we would do but that he somehow does it on a larger or more ennobling scale. It is the James Stewart quality. But few actors can obtain it; with most you see their egos peeking through or you catch them trying too hard. The camera is a lie detector and Hanks must be a fundamentally good person to play such roleseither that or he is an even better actor than we think. 227 Personal life Marriage and family Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson at the 1989 Oscars Hanks married American actress Samantha Lewes 19522002 in 1978.

He said I must say that when I go to churchand I do go to churchI ponder the mystery. I meditate on the why? of why people are as they are and why bad things happen to good people and why good things happen to bad people ...
