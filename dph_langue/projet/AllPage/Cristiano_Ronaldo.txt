While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position he was able to use his pace and acceleration agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair often displaying an array of tricks and feints 248 249 such as the step overs and so-called chops that became his trademark; 250 he has also been known to use the flip-flap . 251 Ronaldo controlling the ball on his chest during a 201011 La Liga game against Almeria . At his peak he was known for his exceptional speed and athleticism. 252 His strength and jumping ability combined with his elevation heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m 6 ft 1 1 2 in give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently many of his goals have been headers. 253 254 255 Ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history measuring 2.93 meters 9 ft 7 in which he achieved during a match against Manchester United while playing for Real Madrid in the round-of-16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2013. 256 Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team often dropping deep to pick up the ball participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates courtesy of his vision and passing ability. 248 253 In his final seasons at United Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. 253 He developed into a prolific goalscorer capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot courtesy of his striking ability. 253 An accurate penalty kick taker 257 he also became a set piece specialist renowned for his powerful bending free kicks . 258 When taking free kicks Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano . 259 He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball which involves him standing with his legs far apart. 260 Regarding Ronaldos unique style of taking free kicks former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: People used to put the ball down walk away run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down the concentration level is high he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs he is saying All eyes on me and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him. 261 As Ronaldo entered his thirties he began to dribble less. 262 At Real Madrid Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role while his creative and defensive duties became more limited although not entirely diminished. 263 Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho he was later moved back onto the left wing though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. 263 264 265 Madrids counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. 266 267 268 This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a false attacking or goalscoring winger as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area despite actually playing on the left flank. 264 269 From 2013 onwards under manager Carlo Ancelotti he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement completing fewer dribbles and passes per game and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. 263 270 271 Since 2017 Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball positional sense link-up play and finishing as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities. 272 273 274 In his first season at Juventus Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing in a 4231 or 433 formation in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandzukic . In this role he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such aside from scoring goals himself he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates crosses. 275 276 On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandzukic in a 4312 442 or 352 formation. 277 278 279 He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri . 276 Reception and image In the six years we had him you just saw his game grow all the time and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making his maturity his experience plus all the great skills he has got they all make him the complete player.
