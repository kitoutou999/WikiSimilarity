Putin has held continuous positions as president or prime minister since 1999: e as prime minister from 1999 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2012 and as president from 2000 to 2008 and since 2012. f 7 He is the longest-serving Russian or Soviet leader since Joseph Stalin . Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg . In 1996 he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin . He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service FSB and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsins resignation Putin became acting president and in less than four months was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004 . Due to constitutional limitations of two consecutive presidential terms Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev . He returned to the presidency in 2012 following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests and was reelected in 2018 . During Putins initial presidential tenure the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year 8 driven by economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas. 9 10 Additionally Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists reestablishing federal control over the region. 11 12 While serving as prime minister under Medvedev he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms . In his third presidential term Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions resulting in international sanctions and a financial crisis in Russia . He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war ultimately securing permanent naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean . 13 14 15 In February 2022 during his fourth presidential term Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions . In September 2022 he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts together roughly the size of Portugal into Russia . In March 2023 the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes 16 related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war . 17 In April 2021 after a referendum he signed into law constitutional amendments that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more potentially extending his presidency to 2036. 18 19 In March 2024 he was reelected to another term. Under Putins rule the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship with a personality cult . 20 21 22 His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia and a lack of free and fair elections . 23 24 25 Russia has consistently received very low scores on Transparency International s Corruption Perceptions Index The Economist Democracy Index Freedom House s Freedom in the World index and the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index . Early life Putin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad Soviet Union now Saint Petersburg Russia 26 the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin 19111999 and Maria Ivanovna Putina nee Shelomova; 19111998. His grandfather Spiridon Putin 18791965 was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin . 27 28 Putins birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert born in the 1930s died in infancy and Viktor born in 1940 died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany s forces in World War II . 29 30 Putins father Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin Putins mother Maria Ivanovna Shelomova Putins mother was a factory worker and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. During the early stage of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD . 31 32 33 Later he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942. 34 Putins maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941 and his maternal uncles disappeared on the Eastern Front during World War II. 35 Education On 1 September 1960 Putin started at School No. 193 at Baskov Lane near his home. He was one of a few in his class of about 45 pupils who were not yet members of the Young Pioneer Komsomol organization. At the age of 12 he began to practice sambo and judo. 36 In his free time he enjoyed reading the works of Karl Marx Friedrich Engels and Lenin. 37 Putin attended Saint Petersburg High School 281 with a German language immersion program. 38 He is fluent in German and often gives speeches and interviews in that language. 39 40 Putin c. 1960s Putin studied law at the Leningrad State University named after Andrei Zhdanov now Saint Petersburg State University in 1970 and graduated in 1975. 41 His thesis was on The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in International Law . 42 While there he was required to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union CPSU; he remained a member until it ceased to exist in 1991. 43 Putin met Anatoly Sobchak an assistant professor who taught business law g and who later became the co-author of the Russian constitution . Putin was influential in Sobchaks career in Saint Petersburg and Sobchak was influential in Putins career in Moscow. 44 In 1997 Putin received a degree in economics kandidat ekonomicheskikh nauk at the Saint Petersburg Mining University for a thesis on energy dependencies and their instrumentalisation in foreign policy. 45 46 His supervisor was Vladimir Litvinenko who in 2000 and again in 2004 managed his presidential election campaigns in St Petersburg. 47 Igor Danchenko and Clifford Gaddy consider Putin to be a plagiarist according to Western standards. One book from which he copied entire paragraphs is the Russian-language edition of King and Cleland s Strategic Planning and Policy 1978. 47 Balzer wrote on the Putin thesis and Russian energy policy and concludes along with Olcott that The primacy of the Russian state in the countrys energy sector is non-negotiable and cites the insistence on majority Russian ownership of any joint-venture particularly since BASF signed the Gazprom Nord Stream - Yuzhno-Russkoye deal in 2004 with a 4951 structure as opposed to the older 5050 split of British Petroleum s TNK-BP project. 48 KGB career Putin in the KGB c. 1980 In 1975 Putin joined the KGB and trained at the 401st KGB School in Okhta Leningrad . 49 50 After training he worked in the Second Chief Directorate counterintelligence before he was transferred to the First Chief Directorate where he monitored foreigners and consular officials in Leningrad. 49 51 52 In September 1984 Putin was sent to Moscow for further training at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute . 53 54 55 From 1985 to 1990 he served in Dresden East Germany 56 using a cover identity as a translator. 57 While posted in Dresden Putin worked as one of the KGBs liaison officers to the Stasi secret police and was reportedly promoted to lieutenant colonel . According to the official Kremlin presidential site the East German communist regime commended Putin with a bronze medal for faithful service to the National Peoples Army . Putin has publicly conveyed delight over his activities in Dresden once recounting his confrontations with anti-communist protestors of 1989 who attempted the occupation of Stasi buildings in the city. 58 Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the KGB Russian-American Masha Gessen wrote in their 2012 biography of Putin. 57 His work was also downplayed by former Stasi spy chief Markus Wolf and Putins former KGB colleague Vladimir Usoltsev. Journalist Catherine Belton wrote in 2020 that this downplaying was actually cover for Putins involvement in KGB coordination and support for the terrorist Red Army Faction whose members frequently hid in East Germany with the support of the Stasi. Dresden was preferred as a marginal town with only a small presence of Western intelligence services. 59 According to an anonymous source who claimed to be a former RAF member at one of these meetings in Dresden the militants presented Putin with a list of weapons that were later delivered to the RAF in West Germany. Klaus Zuchold who claimed to be recruited by Putin said that Putin handled a neo-Nazi Rainer Sonntag and attempted to recruit an author of a study on poisons. 59 Putin reportedly met Germans to be recruited for wireless communications affairs together with an interpreter. He was involved in wireless communications technologies in South-East Asia due to trips of German engineers recruited by him there and to the West. 52 However a 2023 investigation by Der Spiegel reported that the anonymous source had never been an RAF member and is considered a notorious fabulist with several previous convictions including for making false statements . 60 The Stasi identity card of Vladimir Putin who worked in Dresden as a KGB liaison officer to the Stasi 61 According to Putins official biography during the fall of the Berlin Wall that began on 9 November 1989 he saved the files of the Soviet Cultural Center House of Friendship and of the KGB villa in Dresden for the official authorities of the would-be united Germany to prevent demonstrators including KGB and Stasi agents from obtaining and destroying them. He then supposedly burnt only the KGB files in a few hours but saved the archives of the Soviet Cultural Center for the German authorities. Nothing is told about the selection criteria during this burning; for example concerning Stasi files or about files of other agencies of the German Democratic Republic or of the USSR. He explained that many documents were left to Germany only because the furnace burst but many documents of the KGB villa were sent to Moscow. 62 After the collapse of the Communist East German government Putin was to resign from active KGB service because of suspicions aroused regarding his loyalty during demonstrations in Dresden and earlier although the KGB and the Soviet Army still operated in eastern Germany. He returned to Leningrad in early 1990 as a member of the active reserves where he worked for about three months with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University reporting to Vice-Rector Yuriy Molchanov while working on his doctoral dissertation. 52 There he looked for new KGB recruits watched the student body and renewed his friendship with his former professor Anatoly Sobchak soon to be the Mayor of Leningrad . 63 Putin claims that he resigned with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 20 August 1991 63 on the second day of the 1991 Soviet coup detat attempt against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev . 64 Putin said: As soon as the coup began I immediately decided which side I was on although he noted that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part of his life with the organs . 65 Political career Main articles: Political career of Vladimir Putin and Russia under Vladimir Putin Further information: Putinism and List of speeches given by Vladimir Putin See also: Politics of Russia 19901996: Saint Petersburg administration In May 1990 Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the mayor of Leningrad Anatoly Sobchak . In a 2017 interview with Oliver Stone Putin said that he resigned from the KGB in 1991 following the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev as he did not agree with what had happened and did not want to be part of the intelligence in the new administration. 66 According to Putins statements in 2018 and 2021 he may have worked as a private taxi driver to earn extra money or considered such a job. 67 68 Putin Lyudmila Narusova and Ksenia Sobchak at the funeral of Putins former mentor 69 Anatoly Sobchak Mayor of Saint Petersburg 19911996 On 28 June 1991 Putin became head of the Committee for External Relations of the Mayors Office with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments 70 and registering business ventures. Within a year Putin was investigated by the city legislative council led by Marina Salye . It was concluded that he had understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at 93 million in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived. 71 41 Despite the investigators recommendation that Putin be fired Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until 1996. 72 73 From 1994 to 1996 he held several other political and governmental positions in Saint Petersburg. In March 1994 Putin was appointed as first deputy chairman of the Government of Saint Petersburg . In May 1995 he organized the Saint Petersburg branch of the pro-government Our Home Russia political party the liberal party of power founded by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . In 1995 he managed the legislative election campaign for that party and from 1995 through June 1997 he was the leader of its Saint Petersburg branch. 19961999: Early Moscow career In June 1996 Sobchak lost his bid for re-election in Saint Petersburg and Putin who had led his election campaign resigned from his positions in the city administration. He moved to Moscow and was appointed as deputy chief of the Presidential Property Management Department headed by Pavel Borodin . He occupied this position until March 1997. He was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and the CPSU to the Russian Federation. 44 Putin as FSB director 1998 On 26 March 1997 President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of the Presidential Staff a post which he retained until May 1998 and chief of the Main Control Directorate of the Presidential Property Management Department until June 1998. His predecessor in this position was Alexei Kudrin and his successor was Nikolai Patrushev both future prominent politicians and Putins associates. 44 On 3 April 1997 Putin was promoted to 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation the highest federal state civilian service rank . 74 On 27 June 1997 at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute guided by rector Vladimir Litvinenko Putin defended his Candidate of Science dissertation in economics titled Strategic Planning of the Reproduction of the Mineral Resource Base of a Region under Conditions of the Formation of Market Relations . 75 This exemplified the custom in Russia whereby a young rising official would write a scholarly work in mid-career. 76 Putins thesis was plagiarized . 77 Fellows at the Brookings Institution found that 15 pages were copied from an American textbook. 78 79 On 25 May 1998 Putin was appointed First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff for the regions in succession to Viktoriya Mitina . On 15 July he was appointed head of the commission for the preparation of agreements on the delimitation of the power of the regions and head of the federal center attached to the president replacing Sergey Shakhray . After Putins appointment the commission completed no such agreements although during Shakhrays term as the head of the Commission 46 such agreements had been signed. 80 Later after becoming president Putin cancelled all 46 agreements. 44 On 25 July 1998 Yeltsin appointed Putin director of the Federal Security Service FSB the primary intelligence and security organization of the Russian Federation and the successor to the KGB. 81 In 1999 Putin described communism as a blind alley far away from the mainstream of civilization . 82 1999: First premiership Further information: Vladimir Putins First Cabinet Putin with President Boris Yeltsin on 31 December 1999 when Yeltsin announced his resignation On 9 August 1999 Putin was appointed one of three first deputy prime ministers and later on that day was appointed acting prime minister of the Government of the Russian Federation by President Yeltsin . 83 Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor. Later on that same day Putin agreed to run for the presidency. 84 On 16 August the State Duma approved his appointment as prime minister with 233 votes in favor vs. 84 against 17 abstained 85 while a simple majority of 226 was required making him Russias fifth prime minister in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment few expected Putin virtually unknown to the general public to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin Putin did not choose ministers himself his cabinet was determined by the presidential administration. 86 Yeltsins main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to replace the ailing president and they fought hard to prevent Putins emergence as a potential successor. Following the September 1999 Russian apartment bombings and the invasion of Dagestan by mujahideen including the former KGB agents based in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria Putins law-and-order image and unrelenting approach to the Second Chechen War soon combined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake his rivals. While not formally associated with any party Putin pledged his support to the newly formed Unity Party 87 which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote 23.3 in the December 1999 Duma elections and in turn supported Putin. 19992000: Acting presidency Main article: Putins rise to power On 31 December 1999 Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and according to the Constitution of Russia Putin became Acting President of the Russian Federation . On assuming this role Putin went on a previously scheduled visit to Russian troops in Chechnya. 88 The first presidential decree that Putin signed on 31 December 1999 was titled On guarantees for the former president of the Russian Federation and the members of his family . 89 90 This ensured that corruption charges against the outgoing President and his relatives would not be pursued. 91 This was most notably targeted at the Mabetex bribery case in which Yeltsins family members were involved. On 30 August 2000 a criminal investigation number 18238278-95 in which Putin himself 92 93 as a member of the Saint Petersburg city government was one of the suspects was dropped. On 30 December 2000 yet another case against the prosecutor general was dropped for lack of evidence despite thousands of documents having been forwarded by Swiss prosecutors. 94 On 12 February 2001 Putin signed a similar federal law which replaced the decree of 1999. A case regarding Putins alleged corruption in metal exports from 1992 was brought back by Marina Salye but she was silenced and forced to leave Saint Petersburg. 95 While his opponents had been preparing for an election in June 2000 Yeltsins resignation resulted in the presidential elections being held on 26 March 2000; Putin won in the first round with 53 of the vote. 96 97 20002004: First presidential term See also: Vladimir Putin 2000 presidential campaign Putin taking the presidential oath beside Boris Yeltsin May 2000 The inauguration of President Putin occurred on 7 May 2000. He appointed the minister of finance Mikhail Kasyanov as prime minister. 98 The first major challenge to Putins popularity came in August 2000 when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the Kursk submarine disaster . 99 That criticism was largely because it took several days for Putin to return from vacation and several more before he visited the scene. 99 Between 2000 and 2004 Putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country apparently winning a power-struggle with the Russian oligarchs reaching a grand bargain with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers in exchange for their explicit support forand alignment withPutins government. 100 101 Putin with Tom Brokaw before an interview on 2 June 2000 The Moscow theater hostage crisis occurred in October 2002. Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the deaths of 130 hostages in the special forces rescue operation during the crisis would severely damage President Putins popularity. However shortly after the siege had ended the Russian president enjoyed record public approval ratings83 of Russians declared themselves satisfied with Putin and his handling of the siege. 102 In 2003 a referendum was held in Chechnya adopting a new constitution which declares that the Republic of Chechnya is a part of Russia; on the other hand the region did acquire autonomy. 103 Chechnya has been gradually stabilized with the establishment of the Parliamentary elections and a Regional Government. 104 105 Throughout the Second Chechen War Russia severely disabled the Chechen rebel movement; however sporadic attacks by rebels continued to occur throughout the northern Caucasus. 106 20042008: Second presidential term See also: Vladimir Putin 2004 presidential campaign Putin with Junichiro Koizumi Jacques Chirac Gerhard Schroder George W. Bush and other state leaders in Moscow during the Victory Day parade 9 May 2005 107 On 14 March 2004 Putin was elected to the presidency for a second term receiving 71 of the vote. 108 The Beslan school hostage crisis took place on 13 September 2004; more than 330 people died including 186 children. 109 The near 10-year period prior to the rise of Putin after the dissolution of Soviet rule was a time of upheaval in Russia. 110 In a 2005 Kremlin speech Putin characterized the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century . 111 Putin elaborated Moreover the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself. 112 The countrys cradle-to-grave social safety net was gone and life expectancy declined in the period preceding Putins rule. 113 In 2005 the National Priority Projects were launched to improve Russias health care education housing and agriculture . 114 115 The continued criminal prosecution of the wealthiest man in Russia at the time president of Yukos oil and gas company Mikhail Khodorkovsky for fraud and tax evasion was seen by the international press as a retaliation for Khodorkovskys donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the Kremlin. 116 Khodorkovsky was arrested Yukos was bankrupted and the companys assets were auctioned at below-market value with the largest share acquired by the state company Rosneft . 117 The fate of Yukos was seen as a sign of a broader shift of Russia towards a system of state capitalism . 118 119 This was underscored in July 2014 when shareholders of Yukos were awarded 50 billion in compensation by the Permanent Arbitration Court in The Hague . 120 On 7 October 2006 Anna Politkovskaya a journalist who exposed corruption in the Russian army and its conduct in Chechnya was shot in the lobby of her apartment building on Putins birthday. The death of Politkovskaya triggered international criticism with accusations that Putin had failed to protect the countrys new independent media. 121 122 Putin himself said that her death caused the government more problems than her writings. 123 In a January 2007 meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel Putin brought in his Labrador in front of her who has a phobia of dogs . In January 2007 Putin met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Black Sea residence in Sochi two weeks after Russia switched off oil supplies to Germany. Putin brought his black Labrador Konni in front of Merkel who has a noted phobia of dogs and looked visibly uncomfortable in its presence adding Im sure it will behave itself causing a furor among the German press corps. 124 125 When asked about the incident in a January 2016 interview with Bild Putin claimed he was not aware of her phobia adding I wanted to make her happy. When I found out that she did not like dogs I of course apologized. 126 Merkel later told a group of reporters I understand why he has to do this to prove hes a man. Hes afraid of his own weakness. Russia has nothing no successful politics or economy. All they have is this. 125 Putin Bill Clinton George H. W. Bush and Lyudmila Putina at the state funeral of Boris Yeltsin in Moscow April 2007 In a speech in February 2007 at the Munich Security Conference Putin complained about the feeling of insecurity engendered by the dominant position in geopolitics of the United States and observed that a former NATO official had made rhetorical promises not to expand into new countries in Eastern Europe. On 14 July 2007 Putin announced that Russia would suspend implementation of its Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe obligations effective after 150 days 127 128 and suspend its ratification of the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty which treaty was shunned by NATO members abeyant Russian withdrawal from Transnistria and the Republic of Georgia . Moscow continued to participate in the joint consultative group because it hoped that dialogue could lead to the creation of an effective new conventional arms control regime in Europe. 129 Russia did specify steps that NATO could take to end the suspension. These include NATO members cutting their arms allotments and further restricting temporary weapons deployments on each NATO members territory. Russia also wanted constraints eliminated on how many forces it can deploy in its southern and northern flanks. Moreover it is pressing NATO members to ratify a 1999 updated version of the accord known as the Adapted CFE Treaty and demanding that the four alliance members outside the original treaty Estonia Latvia Lithuania and Slovenia join it. 128 In early 2007 Dissenters Marches were organized by the opposition group The Other Russia 130 led by former chess champion Garry Kasparov and national-Bolshevist leader Eduard Limonov .

According to Stephen White under the presidency of Putin Russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a second edition of the American or British political system but rather a system that was closer to Russias own traditions and circumstances. 374 Some commentators have described Putins administration as a sovereign democracy . 375 376 377 According to the proponents of that description primarily Vladislav Surkov the governments actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within Russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country. 378 The practice of the system is characterized by Swedish economist Anders Aslund as manual management commenting: After Putin resumed the presidency in 2012 his rule is best described as manual management as the Russians like to put it. Putin does whatever he wants with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of August 1998 Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore he cares about financial stability. 379 The period after 2012 saw mass protests against the falsification of elections censorship and toughening of free assembly laws. In July 2000 according to a law proposed by Putin and approved by the Federal Assembly of Russia Putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal subjects. In 2004 the direct election of those heads usually called governors by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be nominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional legislatures. 380 381 This was seen by Putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and get rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime. 382 This and other government actions effected under Putins presidency have been criticized by many independent Russian media outlets and Western commentators as anti-democratic. 383 384 During his first term in office Putin opposed some of the Yeltsin-era business oligarchs as well as his political opponents resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as Boris Berezovsky Vladimir Gusinsky and Mikhail Khodorkovsky ; other oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich and Arkady Rotenberg are friends and allies with Putin. 385 Putin succeeded in codifying land law and tax law and promulgated new codes on labor administrative criminal commercial and civil procedural law. 386 Under Medvedevs presidency Putins government implemented some key reforms in the area of state security the Russian police reform and the Russian military reform . 387 Economic industrial and energy policies See also: Economy of Russia Energy policy of Russia Great Recession in Russia Russian financial crisis 20142016 and Economic impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Russian GDP since the end of the Soviet Union Sergey Guriyev when talking about Putins economic policy divided it into four distinct periods: the reform years of his first term 19992003; the statist years of his second term 2004the first half of 2008; the world economic crisis and recovery the second half of 20082013; and the Russo-Ukrainian War Russias growing isolation from the global economy and stagnation 2014present. 388 In 2000 Putin launched the Programme for the Socio-Economic Development of the Russian Federation for the Period 20002010 but it was abandoned in 2008 when it was 30 complete. 389 Fueled by the 2000s commodities boom including record-high oil prices 9 10 under the Putin administration from 2000 to 2016 an increase in income in USD terms was 4.5 times. 390 During Putins first eight years in office industry grew substantially as did production construction real incomes credit and the middle class. 391 392 A fund for oil revenue allowed Russia to repay Soviet Unions debts by 2005. Russia joined the World Trade Organization in August 2012. 393 In 2006 Putin launched an industry consolidation programme to bring the main aircraft-producing companies under a single umbrella organization the United Aircraft Corporation UAC. 394 395 In September 2020 the UAC general director announced that the UAC will receive the largest-ever post-Soviet government support package for the aircraft industry in order to pay and renegotiate the debt. 396 397 Putin Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller and Chinese President Xi Jinping . The Russian economy is heavily dependent on the export of natural resources such as oil and natural gas. 398 In 2014 Putin signed a deal to supply China with 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Power of Siberia which Putin has called the worlds biggest construction project was launched in 2019 and is expected to continue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to China of 400bn. 399 The ongoing financial crisis began in the second half of 2014 when the Russian ruble collapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and international sanctions against Russia . These events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and capital flight although it has also been argued that the sanctions had little to no effect on Russias economy. 400 401 402 In 2014 the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project named Putin their Person of the Year for furthering corruption and organized crime. 403 404 According to Meduza Putin has since 2007 predicted on a number of occasions that Russia will become one of the worlds five largest economies. In 2013 he said Russia was one of the five biggest economies in terms of gross domestic product but still lagged behind other countries on indicators such as labour productivity. 405 By the end of 2023 Putin planned to spend almost 40 of public expenditures on defense and security. 406 Environmental policy Main articles: Environment of Russia and Environmental issues in Russia In 2004 Putin signed the Kyoto Protocol treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 407 However Russia did not face mandatory cuts because the Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and Russias greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union. 408 Religious policy Main article: Religion in Russia Putin with religious leaders of Russia February 2001 Putin regularly attends the most important services of the Russian Orthodox Church on the main holy days and has established a good relationship with Patriarchs of the Russian Church the late Alexy II of Moscow and the current Kirill of Moscow . As president Putin took an active personal part in promoting the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate signed 17 May 2007 which restored relations between the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia after the 80-year schism. 409 Under Putin the Hasidic Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia became increasingly influential within the Jewish community partly due to the influence of Federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with Putin notably Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich . 410 411 According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency Putin is popular amongst the Russian Jewish community who see him as a force for stability. Russias chief rabbi Berel Lazar said Putin paid great attention to the needs of our community and related to us with a deep respect . 412 In 2016 Ronald S. Lauder the president of the World Jewish Congress also praised Putin for making Russia a country where Jews are welcome . 413 Human rights organizations and religious freedom advocates have criticized the state of religious freedom in Russia. 414 In 2016 Putin oversaw the passage of legislation that prohibited missionary activity in Russia. 414 Nonviolent religious minority groups have been repressed under anti-extremism laws especially Jehovahs Witnesses . 415 One of the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia has a constitutional reference to God . 416 Military development Main article: 2008 Russian military reform Putin with Russias long-serving Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu left and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov at the Vostok 2018 military exercise The resumption of long-distance flights of Russias strategic bombers was followed by the announcement by Russian Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov during his meeting with Putin on 5 December 2007 that 11 ships including the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov would take part in the first major navy sortie into the Mediterranean since Soviet times. 417 418 Key elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million reducing the number of officers centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 systemic military training centres creating a professional NCO corps reducing the size of the central command introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff elimination of cadre-strength formations reorganising the reserves reorganising the army into a brigade system and reorganising air forces into an airbase system instead of regiments. 419 Russian postage stamp honoring a soldier killed in the Russo-Ukrainian War . As of September 2024 the number of Russian soldiers killed and wounded in Ukraine was estimated at about 600 000. 420 According to the Kremlin Putin embarked on a build-up of Russias nuclear capabilities because of U.S. President George W. Bush s unilateral decision to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty . 421 To counter what Putin sees as the United States goal of undermining Russias strategic nuclear deterrent Moscow has embarked on a program to develop new weapons capable of defeating any new American ballistic missile defense or interception system. Some analysts believe that this nuclear strategy under Putin has brought Russia into violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty . 422 Accordingly U.S. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would no longer consider itself bound by the treatys provisions raising nuclear tensions between the two powers. 422 This prompted Putin to state that Russia would not launch first in a nuclear conflict but that an aggressor should know that vengeance is inevitable that he will be annihilated and we would be the victims of the aggression. We will go to heaven as martyrs . 423 Putin has also sought to increase Russian territorial claims in the Arctic and its military presence there. In August 2007 Russian expedition Arktika 2007 part of research related to the 2001 Russian territorial extension claim planted a flag on the seabed at the North Pole. 424 Both Russian submarines and troops deployed in the Arctic have been increasing. 425 426 Human rights policy Main article: Human rights in Russia See also: Dima Yakovlev Law Russian foreign agent law and Russian Internet Restriction Bill Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny attends a march in memory of assassinated opposition politician Boris Nemtsov Moscow 29 February 2020. New York City-based NGO Human Rights Watch in a report entitled Laws of Attrition authored by Hugh Williamson the British director of HRWs Europe Central Asia Division has claimed that since May 2012 when Putin was reelected as president Russia has enacted many restrictive laws started inspections of non-governmental organizations harassed intimidated and imprisoned political activists and started to restrict critics. The new laws include the foreign agents law which is widely regarded as over-broad by including Russian human rights organizations which receive some international grant funding the treason law and the assembly law which penalizes many expressions of dissent. 427 428 Human rights activists have criticized Russia for censoring speech of LGBT activists due to the gay propaganda law 429 and increasing violence against LGBT people due to the law. 430 431 432 In 2020 Putin signed a law on labelling individuals and organizations receiving funding from abroad as foreign agents . The law is an expansion of foreign agent legislation adopted in 2012. 433 434 As of June 2020 per Memorial Human Rights Center there were 380 political prisoners in Russia including 63 individuals prosecuted directly or indirectly for political activities including Alexey Navalny and 245 prosecuted for their involvement with one of the Muslim organizations that are banned in Russia. 78 individuals on the list i.e. more than 20 of the total are residents of Crimea. 435 436 As of December 2022 more than 4 000 people were prosecuted for criticizing the war in Ukraine under Russias war censorship laws . 437 The media See also: Mass media in Russia Media freedom in Russia and Propaganda in Russia Putin and Konstantin Ernst chief of Russias main state-controlled TV station Channel One . About 85 of Russians get most of their information from Russian state media. 438 Scott Gehlbach a professor of Political Science at the University of WisconsinMadison has claimed that since 1999 Putin has systematically punished journalists who challenge his official point of view. 439 Maria Lipman an American writing in Foreign Affairs claims The crackdown that followed Putins return to the Kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media which had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently. 440 The Internet has attracted Putins attention because his critics have tried to use it to challenge his control of information. 441 Marian K. Leighton who worked for the CIA as a Soviet analyst in the 1980s says Having muzzled Russias print and broadcast media Putin focused his energies on the Internet. 442 Robert W. Orttung and Christopher Walker reported that Reporters Without Borders for instance ranked Russia 148 in its 2013 list of 179 countries in terms of freedom of the press. It particularly criticized Russia for the crackdown on the political opposition and the failure of the authorities to vigorously pursue and bring to justice criminals who have murdered journalists. Freedom House ranks Russian media as not free indicating that basic safeguards and guarantees for journalists and media enterprises are absent. 443 About two-thirds of Russians use television as their primary source of daily news. 444 In the early 2000s Putin and his circle began promoting the idea in Russian media that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century Romanov tsars who ended Russias Time of Troubles meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the Soviet Union. 445 Promoting conservatism This article is part of a series on Conservatism in Russia Ideologies Eurasianism Duginism Monarchism Tsarism Populism Putinism Russian nationalism All-Russian Christian Ultra Slavophilia Pochvennichestvo Traditionalist conservatism Principles Authority Autocracy Bureaucracy Duty Economic interventionism Family values Imperialism Irredentism Law and order Orthodox values Nuclear Orthodoxy Patriotism Reactionism Russian culture Russification Social hierarchy Social order Sovereign democracy Statism History Black Hundreds Great Russia Intelligentsiya Orthodoxy Autocracy and Nationality Russian Empire White Army White movement Intellectuals Aksakov Dostoevsky Dugin Frank Ilyin Karamzin Katkov Leontiev Obolensky Pobedonostsev Prokhanov Rozanov Semyonov Shafarevich Shcherbatov Solzhenitsyn Sorokin Strakhov Surkov Tikhomirov Tikhon Uvarov Vikulov Wrangel Zhukovsky Literature St Petersburg Dialogues 1821 Sociology of Revolution 1925 The Gulag Archipelago 1973 Politicians Alexander I Alexander III Butina Dubrovin Durnovo Gryzlov Kolchak Kornilov Luzhkov Malyshkin Mizulina Nicholas I Nicholas II Pikhno Pobedonostsev Putin Rodzianko Rogozin Rostopchin Shulgin Slutsky Surkov Tolstoy von Ungern Uvarov Vladimir Volodin Zhirinovsky Parties Active Eurasia Party Great Russia Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Rodina Russian All-Peoples Union Union of Right Forces United Russia Defunct For Truth Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union Peoples Union Pamyat Society Union of the Russian People Organisations All-Russia Peoples Front Izborsky Club Media Elementy Defunct Kievlyanin Kozma Minin Nash Sovremennik Russkoye Znamya Zavtra Znamya Related topics Anti-Americanism Anti-Chechenism Anti-communism Anti-Islamism Anti-Polonism Antisemitism Anti-Tatarism Anti-Turkism Anti-Ukrainianism Criticism of communist party rule Mass killings under communist regimes Politics of Russia Liberalism Russia for Russians Russia under Vladimir Putin Serfdom in Russia Silovik Conservatism portal Russia portal v t e Putin attends the Orthodox Christmas service in the village Turginovo in Kalininsky District Tver Oblast 7 January 2016. Putin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social cultural and political matters both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and neoliberalism and is identified by scholars with Russian conservatism . 446 Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example the Izborsky Club founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist Alexander Prokhanov stresses i Russian nationalism ii the restoration of Russias historical greatness and iii systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies. 447 Vladislav Surkov a senior government official has been one of the key economics consultants during Putins presidency. 448 In cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church . Patriarch Kirill of Moscow head of the Church endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putins terms were like a miracle of God . 449 Steven Myers reports The church once heavily repressed had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions... Now Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state. 450 Mark Woods a Baptist Union of Great Britain minister and contributing editor to Christian Today provides specific examples of how the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine. 451 Some Russian Orthodox believers consider Putin a corrupt and brutal strongman or even a tyrant. Others do not admire him but appreciate that he aggravates their political opponents. Still others appreciate that Putin defends some although not all Orthodox teachings whether or not he believes in them himself. 452 On abortion Putin stated: In the modern world the decision is up to the woman herself. 453 This put him at odds with the Russian Orthodox Church . 454 In 2020 he supported efforts to reduce the number of abortions instead of prohibiting it. 455 On 28 November 2023 during a speech to the World Russian Peoples Council Putin urged Russian women to have seven eight or even more children and said large families must become the norm a way of life for all of Russias people . 456 Putin supported the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum which passed and defined marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman in the Constitution of Russia . 457 458 459 International sporting events Putin FIFA president Gianni Infantino and French president Emmanuel Macron at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final in Russia as French forward Kylian Mbappe receives the best young player award In 2007 Putin led a successful effort on behalf of Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics 460 the first Winter Olympic Games to ever be hosted by Russia. In 2008 the city of Kazan won the bid for the 2013 Summer Universiade ; on 2 December 2010 Russia won the right to host the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup also for the first time in Russian history. In 2013 Putin stated that gay athletes would not face any discrimination at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. 461 Foreign policy Main article: Foreign policy of Vladimir Putin See also: Foreign relations of Russia and List of international presidential trips made by Vladimir Putin Putins visit to the United States November 2001 Generally Putins tenure experiences tensions with the west. 462 463 Anna Borshchevskaya in her 2022 book summarizes Putin main foreign policy objectives as originating in his 30 December 1999 document which appeared on the governments website Russia at the Turn of the Millenium. 464 She presents Putin as orienting himself to the plan that Russia is a country with unique values in danger of losing its unity which... is a historic Russian fear. This again points to the fundamental issue of Russias identity issues and how the state had manipulated these to drive anti-Western security narratives with the aim of eroding the US-led global order... Moreover a look at Russias distribution of forces over the years under Putin has been heavily weighted towards the south Syria Ukraine Middle East another indicator of the Kremlins threat perceptions. 465 466 Leonid Bershidsky analyzed Putins interview with the Financial Times and concluded Putin is an imperialist of the old Soviet school rather than a nationalist or a racist and he has cooperated with and promoted people who are known to be gay. 467 Putin spoke favorably of artificial intelligence in regard to foreign policy Artificial intelligence is the future not only for Russia but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world. 468 Asia See also: IndiaRussia relations ChinaRussia relations IndonesiaRussia relations and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Putin with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in Moscow 9 July 2024 In 2012 Putin wrote an article in Indian newspaper The Hindu saying: The Declaration on Strategic Partnership between India and Russia signed in October 2000 became a truly historic step. 469 470 India remains the largest customer of Russian military equipment and the two countries share a historically strong strategic and diplomatic relationship . 471 In October 2022 Putin described India and China as close allies and partners . 472 Under Putin Russia has maintained positive relations with the Asian states of SCO and BRICS which include China India Pakistan and post-Soviet states of Central Asia. 473 474 In the 21st century Sino-Russian relations have significantly strengthened bilaterally and economicallythe Treaty of Friendship and the construction of the ESPO oil pipeline and the Power of Siberia gas pipeline formed a special relationship between the two great powers . 475 Putin and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe frequently met each other to discuss the JapanRussia territorial disputes. Putin also voiced his willingness of constructing a rail bridge between the two countries. 476 Despite numerous meetings no agreement was signed before Abes resignation in 2020. 477 478 Putin with Chinese president Xi Jinping and other leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Uzbekistan on 16 September 2022 Putin made three visits to Mongolia and has enjoyed good relations with its neighbor. Putin and his Mongolian counterpart signed a permanent treaty on friendship between the two states in September 2019 further enhancing trade and cultural exchanges. 479 480 Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit Indonesia in half a century in 2007 resulting in the signing of an arms deal. 481 In another visit Putin commented on long-standing ties and friendship between Russia and Indonesia. 482 Russia has also boosted relations with Vietnam after 2011 483 and with Afghanistan in the 2010s giving military and economic aid. 484 485 The relations between Russia and the Philippines received a boost in 2016 as Putin forged closer bilateral ties with his Filipino counterpart Rodrigo Duterte . 486 487 Putin has good relations with Malaysia and its then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad . 488 Putin also made the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit North Korea meeting Kim Jong-il in July 2000 shortly after a visit to South Korea. 489 Putin criticized violence in Myanmar against Rohingya minorities in 2017. 490 Following the 2021 Myanmar coup detat Russia has pledged to boost ties with the Myanmar military regime. 491 Post-Soviet states Further information: Colour revolution RussiaUkraine relations BelarusRussia relations GeorgiaRussia relations KyrgyzstanRussia relations KazakhstanRussia relations and Eurasian Economic Union See also: Commonwealth of Independent States Post-Soviet states in English alphabetical order: Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Estonia Georgia Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Latvia Lithuania Moldova Russia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Ukraine Uzbekistan Under Putin the Kremlin has consistently stated that Russia has a sphere of influence and privileged interests over other Post-Soviet states which are referred to as the near abroad in Russia. It has also been stated that the post-Soviet states are strategically vital to Russian interests . 492 Some Russia experts have compared this concept to the Monroe Doctrine . 493 A series of so-called colour revolutions in the post-Soviet states namely the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003 the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in 2005 led to frictions in the relations of those countries with Russia. In December 2004 Putin criticized the Rose and Orange revolutions saying: If you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the post-Soviet space into endless conflict. 494 Putin allegedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NATO Russia could contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea . 495 At the summit he told U.S. President George W. Bush that Ukraine is not even a state! while the following year Putin referred to Ukraine as Little Russia . 496 Following the Revolution of Dignity in March 2014 the Russian Federation annexed Crimea . 497 498 499 According to Putin this was done because Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia . 500 After the Russian annexation of Crimea he said that Ukraine includes regions of Russias historic south and was created on a whim by the Bolsheviks . 501 He went on to declare that the February 2014 ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had been orchestrated by the West as an attempt to weaken Russia. Our Western partners have crossed a line. They behaved rudely irresponsibly and unprofessionally he said adding that the people who had come to power in Ukraine were nationalists neo-Nazis Russophobes and anti-Semites . 501 Putin hosted a meeting of the Russian-led military alliance the Collective Security Treaty Organization CSTO in Moscow on 16 May 2022. In a July 2014 speech during a Russian-supported armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine Putin stated he would use Russias entire arsenal of available means up to operations under international humanitarian law and the right of self-defence to protect Russian speakers outside Russia. 502 503 With the attainment of autocephaly by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in December 2018 and subsequent schism of the Russian Orthodox Church from Constantinople a number of experts came to the conclusion that Putins policy of forceful engagement in post-Soviet republics significantly backfired on him leading to a situation where he annexed Crimea but lost Ukraine and provoked a much more cautious approach to Russia among other post-Soviet countries. 504 505 In late August 2014 Putin stated: People who have their own views on history and the history of our country may argue with me but it seems to me that the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are practically one people. 506 After making a similar statement in late December 2015 he stated: the Ukrainian culture as well as Ukrainian literature surely has a source of its own. 507 In July 2021 he published a lengthy article On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians 508 revisiting these themes and saying the formation of a Ukrainian state hostile to Moscow was comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us 509 510 it was made mandatory reading for military-political training in the Russian Armed Forces. 511 Ukrainian president Zelenskyy German chancellor Merkel French president Macron and Putin met in Paris on 9 December 2019 in the Normandy Format aimed at ending the war in Donbas . In August 2008 Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili attempted to restore control over the breakaway South Ossetia. However the Georgian military was soon defeated in the resulting 2008 South Ossetia War after regular Russian forces entered South Ossetia and then other parts of Georgia then also opened a second front in the other Georgian breakaway province of Abkhazia with Abkhazian forces. 512 513 Despite existing or past tensions between Russia and most of the post-Soviet states Putin has followed the policy of Eurasian integration. Putin endorsed the idea of a Eurasian Union in 2011; 514 515 the concept was proposed by the president of Kazakhstan in 1994. 516 On 18 November 2011 the presidents of Belarus Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement setting a target of establishing the Eurasian Union by 2015. 517 The Eurasian Union was established on 1 January 2015. 518 Under Putin Russias relations have improved significantly with Uzbekistan the second largest post-Soviet republic after Ukraine. This was demonstrated in Putins visit to Tashkent in May 2000 after lukewarm relations under Yeltsin and Islam Karimov who had long distanced itself from Moscow. 519 In another meeting in 2014 Russia agreed to write off Uzbek debt. 520 A theme of a greater Soviet region including the former USSR and many of its neighbors or imperial-era statesrather than just post-Soviet Russiahas been consistent in Putins May Day speeches. 521 522 523 On 22 December 2022 Putin addressed the Security Council in a speech where he did not use the term Special Military Operation but instead called the fighting in Ukraine a war . Anti-Putin activists have called for Putin to be prosecuted for breaking a law passed to stop people calling the Special Military Operation a war. This law carries a penalty of up to 15 years in jail. 524 On 25 December he openly declared in a TV interview that the goal of the invasion is to unite the Russian people . 525 On 14 December 2023 President Putin held a press conference where he indicated that Russian would only negotiate with Ukraine when we achieve our objectives . He stated that another mobilization wasnt required as 617 000 Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine. 526 United States Western Europe and NATO See also: Anti-American sentiment in Russia RussiaNATO relations and RussiaUnited States relations Putin with Pope John Paul II and Holy Sees Secretary of State Angelo Sodano on 5 June 2000 Putin with Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and U.S. president George W. Bush at the NATO-Russia Council meeting in Rome on 28 May 2002 527 Under Putin Russias relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed through several stages. When he first became president relations were cautious but after the 911 attacks Putin quickly supported the U.S. in the War on Terror and the opportunity for partnership appeared. 528 According to Stephen F. Cohen the U.S. repaid by further expansion of NATO to Russias borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty 528 but others pointed out the applications from new countries willing to join NATO was driven primarily by Russians behavior in Chechnya Transnistria Abkhazia Yanayev putsch as well as calls to restore USSR in its previous borders by prominent Russian politicians. 529 530 From 2003 when Russia strongly opposed the U.S. when it waged the Iraq War Putin became ever more distant from the West and relations steadily deteriorated. According to Russia scholar Stephen F. Cohen the narrative of the mainstream U.S. media following that of the White House became anti-Putin. 528 In an interview with Michael Sturmer Putin said there were three questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe: namely the status of Kosovo the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and American plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic and suggested that all three were linked. 531 His view was that concessions by the West on one of the questions might be met with concessions from Russia on another. 531 One single center of power. One single center of force. One single center of decision making. This is the world of one master one sovereign. ... Primarily the United States has overstepped its national borders and in every area. Putin criticizing the United States in his Munich Speech 2007 532 In a January 2007 interview Putin said Russia was in favor of a democratic multipolar world and strengthening the systems of international law . 533 In February 2007 Putin criticized what he called the United States monopolistic dominance in global relations and almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations . He said the result of it is that no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race. 534 This came to be known as the Munich Speech and NATO secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called the speech disappointing and not helpful . 535 Putin with U.S. president Donald Trump at the summit meeting in Helsinki Finland 16 July 2018 The months following Putins Munich Speech 534 were marked by tension and a surge in rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic. Both Russian and American officials however denied the idea of a new Cold War . 536 Putin publicly opposed plans for the U.S. missile shield in Europe and presented President George W. Bush with a counterproposal on 7 June 2007 which was declined. 537 Russia suspended its participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty on 11 December 2007. 538 Putin opposed Kosovos unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 warning that it would destabilize the whole system of international relations. 539 He described the recognition of Kosovos independence by several major world powers as a terrible precedent which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations developed not over decades but over centuries and that they have not thought through the results of what they are doing. At the end of the day it is a two-ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face. 540 In March 2014 Putin used Kosovos declaration of independence as a justification for recognizing the independence of Crimea citing the so-called Kosovo independence precedent . 541 542 After the 911 attacks on the U.S. in 2001 Putin had good relations with American President George W. Bush and many western European leaders. His cooler and more business-like relationship with German chancellor Angela Merkel is often attributed to Merkels upbringing in the former DDR where Putin was stationed as a KGB agent. 543 He had a very friendly and warm relationship with Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi ; 544 the two leaders often described their relationship as a close friendship continuing to organize bilateral meetings even after Berlusconis resignation in November 2011. 545 When Berlusconi died in 2023 Putin described him as an extraordinary man and a true friend . 546 547 Putin held a meeting in Sochi with German chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline in May 2018. The NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011 prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders including Putin who said that the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 is defective and flawed adding: It allows everything.

The percentage willing to emigrate permanently in this group was 41. 60 had favorable views of the US three times more than in the 55 age group. 638 Decline in support for the president and government is visible in other polls such as a rapidly growing readiness to protest against poor living conditions. In May 2020 amid the COVID crisis Putins approval rating was 68 when respondents were presented a list of names closed question 639 and 27 when respondents were expected to name politicians they trust open question. 640 This has been attributed to continued post-Crimea economic stagnation but also an apathetic response to the pandemic crisis in Russia. 641 Polls conducted in November 2021 after the failure of a Russian COVID-19 vaccination campaign indicated distrust of Putin was a major contributing factor for vaccine hesitancy with regional polls indicating numbers as low as 2030 in the Volga Federal District. 642 In May 2021 33 indicated Putin in response to who would you vote for this weekend? among Moscow respondents and 40 outside Moscow. 643 A survey released in October 2021 found 53 of respondents saying they trusted Putin. 644 Observers see a generational struggle among Russians over perception of Putins rule with younger Russians more probably to be against Putin and older Russians more likely to accept the narrative presented by state-controlled media in Russia . 645 Putins support among Russians aged 1824 was only 20 in December 2020. 646 The Levada Center survey showed that 58 of surveyed Russians supported the 2017 Russian protests against high-level corruption. 647 Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 state-controlled TV where most Russians get their news presented the invasion as a special military operation and liberation mission in line with the governments narrative. 648 649 650 The Russian censorship apparatus Roskomnadzor ordered the countrys media to employ information only from state sources or face fines and blocks. 651 The Russian media was banned from using the words war invasion or aggression to describe the invasion 649 with media outlets being blocked as a result. 652 In late February 2022 a survey conducted by the independent research group Russian Field found that 59 of respondents supported the special military operation in Ukraine. 653 According to the poll in the group of 18-to-24-year-olds only 29 supported the special military operation . 654 In late February and mid-March 2022 two polls surveyed Russians sentiments about the special military operation in Ukraine.

For Putin 24 September 2022. Assessments of Putins character as a leader have evolved during his long presidency. His shifting of Russia towards autocracy and weakening of the system of representative government advocated by Boris Yeltsin has met with criticism. 691 Russian dissidents and western leaders now frequently characterise him as a dictator . Others have offered favourable assessments of his impact on Russia. Otto von Habsburg the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary and former Member of the European Parliament was an early critic of Putin. In a newspaper interview 692 in 2002 and in two speeches 693 in 2003 and 2005 he warned of Putin as an international threat that he was cruel and oppressive and a stone cold technocrat . 694 Putin was described in 2015 as a dictator by political opponent Garry Kasparov 695 and as the Tsar of corruption in 2016 by opposition activist and blogger Alexei Navalny . 696 He was described as a bully and arrogant by former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton 697 698 699 and as self-centered by the Dalai Lama . 700 In 2015 opposition politician Boris Nemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a raw materials colony of China. 701 Former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger wrote in 2014 that the West has demonized Putin. 702 Egon Krenz former leader of East Germany said the Cold War never ended adding: After weak presidents like Gorbachev and Yeltsin it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin. 703 Many Russians credit Putin for reviving Russias fortunes. 704 Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev while acknowledging the flawed democratic procedures and restrictions on media freedom during the Putin presidency said that Putin had pulled Russia out of chaos at the end of the Yeltsin years and that Russians must remember that Putin saved Russia from the beginning of a collapse . 704 705 Chechen Republic head and Putin supporter Ramzan Kadyrov stated prior to 2011 that Putin saved both the Chechen people and Russia. 706 Russia has suffered democratic backsliding during Putins tenure. 707 Freedom House has listed Russia as being not free since 2005. 708 Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy 709 710 711 citing purges and jailing of political opponents 712 713 curtailed press freedom 714 715 716 and the lack of free and fair elections. 717 718 719 In 2004 Freedom House warned that Russias retreat from freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989 when the country was part of the Soviet Union . 720 The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Russia as authoritarian since 2011 721 722 whereas it had previously been considered a hybrid regime with some form of democratic government in place. 723 According to political scientist Larry Diamond writing in 2015 no serious scholar would consider Russia today a democracy. 724 Following the jailing of the anti-corruption blogger and activist Alexei Navalny in 2018 Forbes wrote: Putins actions are those of a dictator... As a leader with failing public support he can only remain in power by using force and repression that gets worse by the day. 725 In November 2021 The Economist also noted that Putin had shifted from autocracy to dictatorship . 726 In February 2015 former U.S. Ambassador to Germany John Kornblum wrote in the Wall Street Journal that: 727 Western nations must start the turnaround by emphatically refuting one of Mr. Putins favorite claims: that the West abrogated the promise of democratic partnership with Russia in the 1990 Paris Charter a document produced by a summit that included European governments the U.S. and the Soviet Union convened as Communism crumbled across Eastern Europe... The U.S. and its allies didnt rush in after 1990 to exploit a proud but collapsing Soviet Union a tale that Mr. Putin now spins. I took part in nearly every major negotiation of that era. Never was the idea of humbling Russia considered even for a moment. The Russian leaders we encountered were not angry Prussian-style Junkers who railed against a strategic stab in the back. Many if not all viewed the fall of the Soviet Union as liberation rather than defeat... Contrary to Mr. Putins fictions about NATOs illegal enlargement the West has honored the agreements worked out with Russia two decades ago. After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine Following mounting civilian casualties during the Russian invasion of Ukraine 728 U.S. president Joe Biden called Putin a war criminal and murderous dictator . 729 730 In the 2022 State of the Union Address Biden said that Putin had badly miscalculated . 731 The Ukrainian envoy to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya likened Putin to Adolf Hitler . 732 Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins also likened the Russian leader to Hitler saying he was a deluded autocrat creating misery for millions and that Putin is fighting against democracy ...

These contradictory claims were analyzed by Polygraph.info 781 which looked at a number of reports by Western Anders Aslund estimate of 100160 billion and Russian Stanislav Belkovsky estimated of 40 billion analysts CIA estimate of 40 billion in 2007 as well as counterarguments of Russian media. Polygraph concluded: There is uncertainty on the precise sum of Putins wealth and the assessment by the Director of U.S. National Intelligence apparently is not yet complete. However with the pile of evidence and documents in the Panama Papers and in the hands of independent investigators such as those cited by Dawisha Polygraph.info finds that Danilovs claim that Western intelligence agencies have not been able to find evidence of Putins wealth to be misleading Polygraph.info Are Putins Billions a Myth? In April 2016 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca were leaked to the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung and the Washington -based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists . The name of Putin does not appear in any of the records and Putin denied his involvement with the company. 782 However various media have reported on three of Putins associates on the list. 783 According to the Panama Papers leak close trusted associates of Putin own offshore companies worth US2 billion in total. 784 The German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung regards the possibility of Putins family profiting from this money as plausible. 785 786 According to the paper the US2 billion had been secretly shuffled through banks and shadow companies linked to Putins associates such as construction billionaires Arkady and Boris Rotenberg and Bank Rossiya previously identified by the U.S. State Department as being treated by Putin as his personal bank account had been central in facilitating this. It concludes that Putin has shown he is willing to take aggressive steps to maintain secrecy and protect such communal assets . 787 788 A significant proportion of the money trail leads to Putins best friend Sergei Roldugin . Although a musician and in his own words not a businessman it appears he has accumulated assets valued at 100m and possibly more. It has been suggested he was picked for the role because of his low profile. 783 There have been speculations that Putin in fact owns the funds 789 and Roldugin just acted as a proxy. 790 Garry Kasparov said that Putin controls enough money probably more than any other individual in the history of human race . 791 Residences Official government residences Putin receives Barack Obama at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo 2009. As president and prime minister Putin has lived in numerous official residences throughout the country. 792 These residences include: the Moscow Kremlin Novo-Ogaryovo in Moscow Oblast Gorki-9 near Moscow Bocharov Ruchey in Sochi Dolgiye Borody residence in Novgorod Oblast and Riviera in Sochi. 793 In August 2012 critics of Putin listed the ownership of 20 villas and palaces nine of which were built during Putins 12 years in power. 794 Personal residences Soon after Putin returned from his KGB service in Dresden East Germany he built a dacha in Solovyovka on the eastern shore of Lake Komsomolskoye on the Karelian Isthmus in Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast near St. Petersburg. After the dacha burned down in 1996 Putin built a new one identical to the original and was joined by a group of seven friends who built dachas nearby. In 1996 the group formally registered their fraternity as a co-operative society calling it Ozero Lake and turning it into a gated community . 795 A massive Italianate-style mansion costing an alleged US1 billion 796 and dubbed Putins Palace is under construction near the Black Sea village of Praskoveevka. In 2012 Sergei Kolesnikov a former business associate of Putins told the BBCs Newsnight programme that he had been ordered by Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to oversee the building of the palace. 797 He also said that the mansion built on government land and sporting three helipads plus a private road paid for from state funds and guarded by officials wearing uniforms of the official Kremlin guard service have been built for Putins private use. 798 On 19 January 2021 two days after Alexei Navalny was detained by Russian authorities upon his return to Russia a video investigation by him and the Anti-Corruption Foundation FBK was published accusing Putin of using fraudulently obtained funds to build the estate for himself in what he called the worlds biggest bribe . In the investigation Navalny said that the estate is 39 times the size of Monaco and cost over 100 billion rubles 1.35 billion to construct. It also showed aerial footage of the estate via a drone and a detailed floorplan of the palace that Navalny said was given by a contractor which he compared to photographs from inside the palace that were leaked onto the Internet in 2011. He also detailed an elaborate corruption scheme allegedly involving Putins inner circle that allowed Putin to hide billions of dollars to build the estate. 799 800 801 Since the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine Putin prefers to travel in an armored train to flying. 802 Pets Main article: Pets of Vladimir Putin Putins pet named Verni was a birthday gift from Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow president of Turkmenistan during a meeting in Sochi in October 2017.

His mother secretly baptized him as a baby and she regularly took him to services. 34 According to Putin his religious awakening began after a serious car crash involving his wife in 1993 and a life-threatening fire that burned down their dacha in August 1996. 804 Shortly before an official visit to Israel Putins mother gave him his baptismal cross telling him to get it blessed. Putin states I did as she said and then put the cross around my neck. I have never taken it off since. 34 When asked in 2007 whether he believes in God he responded: There are things I believe which should not in my position at least be shared with the public at large for everybodys consumption because that would look like self-advertising or a political striptease . 805 Putins rumoured confessor is Russian Orthodox bishop Tikhon Shevkunov . 806 The sincerity of his Christianity has been rejected by his former advisor Sergei Pugachev . 807 Sports Putin watches football and supports FC Zenit Saint Petersburg . 808 He also displays an interest in ice hockey and bandy 809 and played in a star-studded hockey game on his 63rd birthday. 810 Putin practicing judo in Tokyo Japan in September 2000 Putin has been practicing judo since he was 11 811 before switching to sambo at the age of fourteen. 812 He won competitions in both sports in Leningrad now Saint Petersburg.

The statement was made because of increasing unconfirmed media speculation about Putins health. Burns had previously been U.S. Ambassador to Russia and had personally observed Putin for over two decades including a personal meeting in November 2021. A Kremlin spokesperson also dismissed rumours of Putins bad health. 819 The Russian political magazine Sobesednik Russian : alleged in 2018 that Putin had a sensory room installed in his private residence in the Novgorod Oblast . 820 The White House as well as Western generals politicians and political analysts have questioned Putins mental health after two years of isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. 821 822 823 In April 2022 tabloid newspaper The Sun reported that based on video footage Putin may have Parkinsons disease . 824 825 826 This speculation which has not been supported by medical professionals has spread in part due to Russias invasion of Ukraine which many saw as an irrational act. 826 The Kremlin 824 rejected the possibility of Parkinsons along with outside medical professionals who stress that it is impossible to diagnose the condition based on video clips alone. 826 Awards and honours Main article: List of awards and honours received by Vladimir Putin At least fifteen countries have awarded Vladimir Putin civilian honors since 2001.
