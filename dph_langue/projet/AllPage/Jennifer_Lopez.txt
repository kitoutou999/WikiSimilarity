Early life Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24 1969 in the Bronx a borough of New York City and raised in its Castle Hill neighborhood. 8 9 10 Her parents Guadalupe Rodriguez and David Lopez were born in Puerto Rico and met in New York City. 11 12 After serving in the Army David worked as a computer technician at Guardian Insurance Company . 13 Guadalupe was a homemaker for the first ten years of Lopezs life and later worked as a Tupperware salesperson 14 and a kindergarten and gym teacher. 15 They divorced in the 1990s after 33 years of marriage. 14 Lopez is a middle child; she has an older sister Leslie and a younger sister Lynda . 16 The three shared a bedroom. 17 Lopez has described her upbringing as strict . 18 She was raised in a Roman Catholic family; she attended Mass every Sunday and received a Catholic education attending Holy Family School and the all-girls Preston High School a private school . 19 In school Lopez ran track on a national level participated in gymnastics and was on the softball team. 20 She danced in school musicals and played a lead role in a production of Godspell . 21 She described herself as a tomboy and very athletic . 22 There was lots of music in the typically Puerto Rican household 23 and Lopez and her sisters were encouraged to sing dance and create their own plays for family events. 24 25 West Side Story made a particular impression on the young Lopez who wanted to be an entertainer from an early age. 19 As a teenager she learned flamenco jazz and ballet at the Kips Bay Boys Girls Club 19 and taught dance to younger students including Kerry Washington . 26 After graduating from high school she had a part-time secretarial job at a law firm and studied business at New Yorks Baruch College for one semester. 27 28 At age 18 she enrolled as a full-time student at Manhattans Phil Black Dance Studio where she had already taken night classes in jazz and tap dance. 18 17 19 Her parents were unhappy with her decision to leave college to pursue a dance career. According to Lopez her parents felt it was foolish because no Latinas did that . 21 Her mother asked her to move out of the family home and they stopped speaking for eight months. 24 29 Lopez moved to Manhattan sleeping in the dance studios office for the first few months. 18 17 19 Career 19891996: Professional dancing and early acting roles Lopezs first professional job came in 1989 when she spent five months touring Europe with the musical revue show Golden Musicals of Broadway . She was upset at being the only member of the chorus not to have a solo and later characterized it as a pivotal moment where she had to try harder and become that much more committed . 30 31 In 1990 she danced alongside MC Hammer in an episode of Yo! MTV Raps 32 and traveled around Japan for four months as a chorus member in Synchronicity . 19 When she returned to the United States she was hired as a backup dancer for New Kids on the Block s performance of Games at the 1991 American Music Awards . 33 She also traveled around America with regional productions of the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma! . 34 During this period Lopez also danced in music videos including Doug E. Fresh s Summertime Richard Rogers Cant Stop Loving You EPMD s Rampage 35 and Samantha Fox s Hurt Me! Hurt Me! But the Pants Stay On . 36 Lopez stated: Id dance in a piece-of-garbage rap or pop video for 50 bucks and make the money last a whole month. 37 Her most high-profile job as a professional dancer was as a Fly Girl jazz-funk dancer on the sketch comedy television series In Living Color . The shows choreographer Rosie Perez said she chose Lopez because she had that look that I knew the audience would tune in to . 38 Lopez moved to Los Angeles in late 1991 for the job; she filmed In Living Color during the day and attended acting classes taught by Aaron Speiser at night. 19 Lopez felt ostracized by the other Fly Girls because of her voluptuous figure and also clashed with Perez. 38 The head of Virgin Records considered signing The Fly Girls as a girl group to rival the Spice Girls but the deal fell apart. 31 After appearing as a Fly Girl in seasons three and four of In Living Color Lopez left to work as a backup dancer for Janet Jackson and appeared in the music video for Thats the Way Love Goes . 31 She was scheduled to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but opted to pursue an acting career instead. 39 Lopez hired In Living Color producer Eric Gold as her manager. He advised Lopez to lose weight if she wanted to succeed as an actress. 40 Lopezs first professional acting job was a small recurring role on the television show South Central 1994. She was invited to audition for the pilot by a casting director who had seen her speak to camera during a behind-the-scenes In Living Color segment. 19 She then acquired an agent and was cast in the CBS show Second Chances ; the series was quickly cancelled but her popularity with viewers led to her being cast in its spin-off Hotel Malibu . 41 She subsequently appeared in the television film Lost in the Wild 1993. 42 For her first major movie role in Gregory Nava s 1995 drama Mi Familia Lopez received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress . 43 She then starred in the action comedy Money Train 1995. The film was not a box office success though her performance was reviewed positively 44 which led to her being further noticed in Hollywood. 45 In 1996 Lopez had a supporting role opposite Robin Williams in the comedy Jack which director Francis Ford Coppola cast her in after seeing her performance in Mi Familia . 44 She next starred opposite Jack Nicholson in the neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine 1996 where David Rooney of Variety felt she delivered in juggling the smoldering and soulful sides of the character. 46 19971999: Breakthrough with Selena and On the 6 With her casting as the singer Selena Quintanilla-Perez in the biopic Selena 1997 Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn 1 million. She described her salary for the film as a statement to the world 47 but expressed disappointment that other Latina actors were not being afforded the same opportunities. 48 Despite having previously worked with the films director Gregory Nava on Mi Familia Lopez participated in an intense auditioning process and spent time with the late singers family in Corpus Christi Texas before filming began. 49 50 Selena was a box office hit and Lopezs performance received critical acclaim. 51 52 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as a star-making performance and wrote: She has the star presence to look convincing in front of 100 000 fans. 53 Lopez received her first Golden Globe nomination for the performance. Nava asked the heads of Warner Bros. to fund an Academy Award campaign for Lopez but was told the Academy would never nominate a Latina. 54 Later in 1997 Lopez starred opposite Ice Cube in the horror film Anaconda which received negative reviews from critics but was a box office success. 55 Joe Leydon of Variety found the film silly but said it deserved a little credit for being the first movie of its kind to have a Latina and an African-American as its stars. 56 In the crime film U Turn 1997 57 Lopez appeared topless in a sex scene that was added by director Oliver Stone during filming. Speaking in 2003 Lopez said it was not something I would have chosen to do and that she and Stone fought over it: Its hard being the only woman on a set. 19 Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in the crime caper Out of Sight 1998 Steven Soderbergh s adaptation of the Elmore Leonard 1996 novel . 58 Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal she won rave reviews for her performance. 59 60 Janet Maslin of The New York Times described it as her best movie role thus far and she brings it both seductiveness and grit; if it was hard to imagine a hard-working pistol-packing bombshell on the page it couldnt be easier here. 61 Turan of the Los Angeles Times described Lopez as an actress who can be convincingly tough and devastatingly erotic and said the film solidified her position as a woman you can confidently build a film around. 62 In 2021 Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian named Lopez and Clooneys partnership as one of the best examples of on-screen chemistry in cinema history. 63 Also in 1998 Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the animated film Antz 59 and ventured into product endorsement becoming a national spokesperson for Coca-Cola and LOreal . 64 65 Lopez decided to pursue a music career after working on Selena realizing that she had missed the excitement of the stage . 31 Her new manager Benny Medina sought to position her as a brand name that will cross over into all media. 31 Lopez who was really feeling her Latin roots 66 recorded a Spanish-language demo for circulation among prospective labels. With Lopez being a high-profile personality a bidding war ensued. 67 Tommy Mottola the head of Sony Music s Work Group signed her but suggested that she sing in English instead. 68 Her record deal with Sony was described as lucrative having outbid other offers from Capitol Records and EMI Latin . 69 While Lopez worked on her debut album Sony began a major push to feature her with other high-profile entertainers leading her to appear in the Sean Combs music video Been Around the World 1997. 67 Her debut album On the 6 1999 named after the 6 Subway line which connected her childhood home in the Bronx to Manhattan 70 was met with positive reviews and further propelled her public profile. 71 6 The album was a success and Lopezs debut single If You Had My Love topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks 6 with another single Waiting for Tonight reaching number eight and becoming a celebratory anthem for the new millennium. 72 Other singles from the album included Lets Get Loud which became one of Lopezs signature songs and No Me Ames a duet with future husband Marc Anthony . 6 In July 1999 she performed If You Had My Love and Lets Get Loud at the 1999 FIFA Womens World Cup closing ceremony. It was watched by over one billion viewers worldwide exposing Lopezs music career to a larger international audience. 73 20002002: International success In February 2000 Lopez and then-boyfriend Sean Combs attended the Grammy Awards with Lopez wearing a plunging green Versace silk chiffon dress . 74 The dress generated worldwide attention and became the most popular search query in Googles history leading to the creation of Google Images 75 while boosting Lopezs album and movie ticket sales. 76 Later that year Lopez starred in the psychological thriller The Cell for which she received a 4 million salary. 71 The film where Lopez played a psychologist who uses radical experimental therapy to enter the mind of a killer received mixed reviews but was a box office success. 77 David Edelstein of Slate remarked that the imperious Lopez was trying to look waifishly expectant 78 while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice noted that she appeared to be engaged in some kind of pouting competition in lieu of acting. 79 Lopez became the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in January 2001 with the release of her sophomore album J.Lo and her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner which co-stars Matthew McConaughey . 80 The Wedding Planner received highly negative reviews but became a box office success. 81 Jessica Winter of The Village Voice found Lopez miscast as a buttoned down celibate woman in the film. 82 Lopez titled her album J.Lo after the nickname which her fans and the media had been increasingly referring to her as. She also adopted J.Lo as her stagename. 83 J.Lo received polarized reviews from critics but became the most successful album of her career selling 12 million copies worldwide. 84 It included the singles Love Dont Cost a Thing which reached number one in various countries 6 Im Real featuring Ja Rule which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 85 Aint It Funny and Play . In support of the album Lopez performed two-concert residency in Puerto Rico which was later broadcast in November 2001 as an NBC special Jennifer Lopez in Concert . It was one of the most-watched concert specials of the year in the United States with an audience of almost 12 million. 86 In other 2001 work Lopez launched her first business venture the clothing line J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez . The line catered to women of all sizes as Lopez felt the voluptuous woman was almost ignored in the fashion industry. 83 She also founded her production company Nuyorican Productions with manager Benny Medina. Her next film was the romantic drama Angel Eyes starring opposite Jim Caviezel . 87 Lopezs performance was well-reviewed 88 89 though the film was a critical and commercial disappointment. 90 She was slated to star alongside Ricky Martin in a remake of Elvis Presley s Viva Las Vegas but this did not eventuate. 91 There was a time when I was very overworked and I was doing music and movies and so many things. I was suffering from a lack of sleep ... I was like I dont want to move I dont want to talk I dont want to do anything. It was on that movie Enough ... I had a nervous breakdown . Lopez discussing the height of her fame 92 Lopez released two albums in 2002. The first was J to tha LO! The Remixes which became the first remix album in history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. 93 Its singles included Aint It Funny Murder Remix and Im Gonna Be Alright which reached number one and ten on the Billboard Hot 100 respectively. 7 Lopezs third studio album This Is Me... Then was released in late 2002 and was heavily influenced by her relationship with then-fiance Ben Affleck . It received mixed critical reviews; Billboard s Michael Paoletta noted the considerable growth she reveals as a performer and tunesmith on the album 94 while Jon Caramanica called it the least interesting music on the pop charts today. 95 The album became a commercial success achieving the highest opening sales week of her career. The albums lead single Jenny from the Block which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 was viewed as a response to the notion that Lopez had alienated her core fan base: the black and Hispanic hip-hop community. 96 The album also spawned the number one single All I Have . Lopez starred as an abused wife who fights back in the thriller Enough 2002 a role which required her to learn Krav Maga . 90 97 An overworked Lopez suffered a nervous breakdown in 2001 while filming it. 92 The film received negative reviews; 90 Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt it was tacky material and was surprised to see an actress like Jennifer Lopez involved with the project. 98 Her next film was the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan 2002 in which Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes as a maid and single mother from the Bronx. 99 It became the highest-grossing film of her career. 100 Reviewing Maid in Manhattan A. O. Scott of The New York Times enjoyed Lopez as a romantic lead and said her greatest skill as an actress was her ability to melt without cracking the hard shell of composure she wears. 101 In 2002 business ventures Lopez opened Madres a Los Angeles restaurant serving Latin cuisine 102 and released her first fragrance Glow by JLo . It became the top-selling fragrance in the U.S. 103 20032009: Media scrutiny and career downturn Lopez arriving at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2004 Lopez became the subject of widespread media criticism in 2003 due to her public relationship with Ben Affleck and the tabloid depiction of her as a demanding diva. 104 She fired both her personal manager Benny Medina and her publicist in mid-2003; The New York Times reported that movie executives had become frustrated by having their communications with Lopez largely filtered through Medina. 105 That year Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli which was a box-office bomb and is considered one of the worst films of all time . 100 106 107 Rex Reed of The Observer criticized the lead actors calling them pathetically incompetent in both craft and talent . 108 Roger Ebert agreed that the movie doesnt quite work but found Lopez and Affleck appealing in their performances and noted the couples chemistry. 109 Later in 2003 she released her second fragrance Still Jennifer Lopez and became the face of Louis Vuitton s fall advertising campaign. 110 Lopez had a minor role opposite Affleck in the film Jersey Girl 2004. Following test audiences negative reactions to the onscreen couple her screen time was halved. 111 Lopez later described this as the lowest point of her career 112 and admitted she felt eviscerated by the media coverage surrounding Gigli : I lost my sense of self questioned if I belonged in this business thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again. 113 Months later she starred opposite Richard Gere in the romantic comedy-drama Shall We Dance? which was a box-office success. 100 Lopezs clothing lines and two fragrances generated over 300 million in revenue throughout 2004. 80 The marketing for the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law 2005 in which Lopez starred opposite Jane Fonda played up her Gigli -and-tabloid tarnished image and it became a box office success. 100 114 She released her fourth studio album Rebirth in early 2005. Its title was symbolic of Lopezs hopes for a new professional beginning . 115 It was recorded during a period where Lopez felt a little bit lost trying to get my footing in a new life I had just gotten married to singer Marc Anthony ... I wasnt with Benny Medina. 116 In a review of Rebirth journalist Alexis Petridis remarked that the title suggests even Lopez has realised that something is amiss with her career ... Despite the highlights youre still left pondering the question: what happened to Jennifer Lopez? 117 The album reached number two on the Billboard 200 but failed to replicate the sales of her previous albums. 118 Its lead single Get Right however reached number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming one of her most successful songs. 7 Also in 2005 Lopez launched her second fashion label Sweetface which was geared towards high fashion in comparison 119 and appeared in a Kill Bill -inspired Pepsi commercial with Beyonce and David Beckham . 120 The next year she returned to the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 as a featured artist on Control Myself the lead single from LL Cool J s twelfth studio album . 121 Lopezs next three movie projects were box office failures. She starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in the drama An Unfinished Life 2005. Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times predicted that the typical review would be unkind: It will have no respect for Jennifer Lopez because she is going through a period right now when nobody is satisfied with anything she does ... Give Lopez your permission to be good again; she is the same actress now as when we thought her so new and fine. 122 In 2006 she reunited with director Gregory Nava to star in the crime drama Bordertown as a journalist investigating female homicides in Ciudad Juarez Mexico. 123 The film was negatively reviewed and received a direct-to-video release. 100 David DArcy of Screen Daily found Lopez unconvincing as a journalist. 124 In 2007 she starred opposite her then-husband Marc Anthony in the music biopic El Cantante which told the story of Puerto Rican salsa singer Hector Lavoe and his wife Puchi. 125 It did not perform well at the box office and received mixed reviews from film critics; Lopezs performance which she expressed pride in 126 drew both praise and criticism. 115 127 Lopez in 2008 Lopez released two studio albums in 2007. Her fifth album Como Ama una Mujer was her first to be recorded entirely in Spanish. 128 Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly acknowledged that the album offered fairly persuasive proof that Lopez can sing but was unimpressed by the flaccid torch songs. 129 It became the fifth Spanish album to debut in the top ten of the Billboard 200 and achieved the highest first-week sales for an artists debut Spanish album at the time. 130 The lead single Que Hiciste reached number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 while the second single Me Haces Falta failed to chart. Lopezs sixth studio album Brave released later that year was her lowest-charting album worldwide. 131 Jonathan Bernstein of Entertainment Weekly was disappointed that Lopez had returned to listless vocals for her back-to-the-dance-floor album. 132 The album debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200 133 and produced two singles Do It Well and Hold It Dont Drop It . The first peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart while the latter failed to chart. While pregnant with twins Lopez embarked upon her first ever concert tour a show co-headlined by Anthony in September 2007; the tour was well received. 115 134 She also created produced and was featured in the MTV show DanceLife which she described as a passion project . 115 After giving birth to twins in February 2008 Lopez took a career break. 135 Her restaurant Madres closed permanently 102 as did her two fashion lines. 136 After rehiring former manager Medina 137 Lopez released two songs in late 2009 Louboutins and Fresh Out of the Oven . The songs were intended for her seventh studio album but failed to make an appearance on the Billboard charts leading to her departure from Sony Music and Epic Records . 138 20102015: American Idol and career revival Lopez performing during her Dance Again World Tour in Paris France in 2012 Lopezs first theatrical role in three years was in the romantic comedy The Back-up Plan 2010. 135 Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was unimpressed by the movie and described Lopez as an appealing screen presence with a disappointing big-screen track record. Thats probably not all her fault: romantic roles for women often are the provenance of the bland or the blonde. 139 A big turning point in Lopezs career came when she joined the judging panel of the singing competition series American Idol for its tenth season replacing Simon Cowell . Despite being advised that it was a huge gamble 140 she accepted the job as she was not getting offered a whole bunch of movies . 141 Lopezs appearance on American Idol in 2011 returned her to prominence. 141 Hannah Elliot of Forbes described it as a remarkable comeback writing: Idol humanized her. Viewers who knew only an attention-grabbing siren met a hardworking self-made empathetic single mother who got emotional when contestants did well and when they failed. 136 Lopez subsequently experienced what Billboard called the most impressive reality-TV-based rejuvenation of a music career ever. 142 After signing a new recording contract with Island Records her seventh studio album Love? was released in early 2011. While the album itself was a moderate commercial success 131 the single On the Floor was the years highest-selling single by a female artist. 143 It reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming her highest-charting single as a lead artist since All I Have . 144 The album produced two more singles Im Into You and Papi which did not achieve similar success . 142 Around this time Lopez became a brand ambassador for LOreal Gilette Venus Tous and Fiat . 136 She also launched the Jennifer Lopez Collection a clothing and homeware line with Tommy Hilfiger for Kohls ; the collection generated an estimated 3 billion in sales during its first year. 140 Lopez returned as a judge for American Idol s eleventh season in 2012 earning a reported 20 million. 136 That year she released her greatest hits album Dance Again... the Hits to fulfil her contractual obligations with her former label Epic Records. 145 Lopez who was divorcing Anthony and navigating the breakup of a family felt as if the albums sole single Dance Again had come to her at the perfect moment . 146 Dance Again reached number 17 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Lopez launched the Dance Again World Tour her first headlining concert tour in mid-2012. It grossed over 1 million per show. 147 Also that year she launched Teeology a luxury T-shirt brand. 148 Lopez returned to the big screen in 2012 starring alongside an ensemble cast in the film What to Expect When Youre Expecting which is based on the 1984 book What to Expect When Youre Expecting . 149 Lopez voiced Shira a saber tooth tiger in the animated film Ice Age: Continental Drift the fourth film in the Ice Age franchise. 150 151 Also in 2012 a talent show QViva!

The audience stays with her all the way . 153 That year Lopez released the single Live It Up founded the mobile phone retail brand Viva Movil 154 and was named chief creative officer of NuvoTV . 155 156 She also served as an executive producer of the television series The Fosters 20132018 a show about a lesbian couple raising a family. Lopezs desire to work on the series was driven by her late aunt who was gay. 157 Lopez at the 25th GLAAD Media Awards in 2014 After a one-season absence Lopez returned to American Idol for its thirteenth season earning a reported 17.5 million. 158 Her eighth studio album A.K.A. was released in mid-2014 through Capitol Records experiencing lacklustre sales becoming her lowest-selling album in the U.S. 159 The album produced three singles: I Luh Ya Papi featuring French Montana First Love and Booty featuring Iggy Azalea . They reached 77 87 and 18 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100. Also that year Lopez released We Are One Ole Ola the official song for the 2014 FIFA World Cup along with Pitbull and Claudia Leitte .

Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing Oprahfied earth madre . 424 People editor Peter Castro said American Idol made Lopez a celebrity of the people whereas before there was a huge distance with the American public. 423 Lopez performing during her Dance Again World Tour in 2012 Lopez is widely celebrated for her curvaceous hourglass figure 425 426 which earned her the nickname La Guitarra the guitar. 83 Vanity Fair described her buttocks as in and of themselves a cultural icon . 427 Recounting her experience on early films Lopez stated: Ive always had costume people looking at me a little weary and immediately fitting me out with things to hide my bottom. 428 She often wears revealing outfits to accentuate her curves. 429 Author Mary Beltran opined that for Lopez to unashamedly display her well-endowed posterior during this time period could be viewed as a revolutionary act with respect to Anglo beauty ideals . 430 However she was also criticized for perceived changes in her image upon launching her music career 430 which included weight loss and lightening her hair . 431 Considered a fashion icon Lopez is known for her sense of style and breaking fashion rules . 432 83 433 She is recognized for both her bold red carpet fashion 434 including 14 appearances at the haute couture Met Gala in New York City and her everyday street style which is discussed ad infinitum by the fashion press. 435 436 British Vogue said she added megawatt glamour to every outfit she wore 274 with Billboard describing her style as scantily clad . 437 Lopezs style has been influenced by women who epitomize old Hollywood glamour like Rita Hayworth as well as her Bronx upbringing and Nuyorican identity. 438 Described as the ultimate sex symbol of the early 21st century 439 various publications have ranked her as the most beautiful or sexiest woman in the world including People 136 People en Espanol 440 Vibe 441 Details 442 and FHM with Lopez topping the latters 100 Sexiest Women list twice. 443 Lopez has criticized this funny notion in America that you cant be a mom and be sexy stating: The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die. 162 Described as one of the most photographed women in the world 444 Lopez has been a tabloid fixture and admits to having a less-than-perfect public image. 445 446 Frances Negron-Muntaner wrote that by 1999 Internet chat rooms exploded with anti-Lopez babble and she became one of the easiest moving targets for cheap laughs as well as anxieties about working-class loud sexuality and specifically Latino visibility. 447 Much of the media coverage surrounding Lopez in the 2000s focused on her dramatic private life 71 with several writers describing her as overexposed at the time despite her continued success. 96 448 Media outlets often compare her to actress Elizabeth Taylor due to her numerous failed relationships and glamorous public persona. 449 450 451 Her high-profile relationship with Combs was described as having defined an age 104 with Vanity Fair writing that they entered the pantheon of slightly notorious celebrity couples: Liz and Dick Frank and Ava. 452 Throughout her career she has also received a bad reputation as being a demanding and outspoken diva 453 430 something which she denies stating: Ive always been fascinated by how much more well-behaved we have to be than men. 454 Some of the backlash and fabricated tabloid stories surrounding Lopez have been attributed to her 1998 interview with Movieline in which she was quoted as criticizing various actors and directors. Lopez who cried for hours after the article was published said the comments were made in jest and she was so misquoted and so taken out of context . 452 In 2003 Lawrence Donegan of The Guardian posited that indefensible misogyny and racism were to blame for her position as the most vilified woman in modern popular culture . 104 In 2021 Ben Affleck said: People were so fucking mean about her; sexist racist ugly vicious shit was written about her in ways that if you wrote it now you would literally be fired for saying some of the things you said. 455 Legacy and cultural impact Main article: Cultural impact of Jennifer Lopez Entertainment industry Lopez waving the Puerto Rican flag in 2009 at the Puerto Rican Day Parade in Manhattan Lopez is regarded as one of the most influential Latin entertainers of all time credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry. 456 457 458 459 460 She was described as the first Latina superstar by writer Ned Zeman 452 and the embodiment of the American Dream by Robert C.
