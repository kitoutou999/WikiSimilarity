House Tudor Father Henry VII of England Mother Elizabeth of York Religion Roman Catholicism 14911534 Church of England 15341547 Signature Henry VIII 28 June 1491 28 January 1547 was King of England from 22 April 1509 until his death in 1547. Henry is known for his six marriages and his efforts to have his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled . His disagreement with Pope Clement VII about such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation separating the Church of England from papal authority. He appointed himself Supreme Head of the Church of England and dissolved convents and monasteries for which he was excommunicated by the pope. Henry brought radical changes to the Constitution of England expanding royal power and ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings in opposition to papal supremacy . He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent and those accused were often executed without a formal trial using bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through his chief ministers some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. Thomas Wolsey Thomas More Thomas Cromwell and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in his administration. Henry was an extravagant spender using proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament . He converted money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources he was often on the verge of financial ruin due to personal extravagance and costly and largely unproductive wars particularly with King Francis I of France Holy Roman Emperor Charles V King James V of Scotland and the Scottish regency under the Earl of Arran and Mary of Guise . He expanded the Royal Navy oversaw the annexation of Wales to England with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 . Henrys contemporaries considered him an attractive educated and accomplished king. He has been described as one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne and his reign described as the most important in English history. 3 4 He was an author and composer. As he aged he became severely overweight and his health suffered. He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful egotistical paranoid and tyrannical monarch. 5 6 He was succeeded by his son Edward VI . Early years Henry VIIIs parents King Henry VII and Queen Elizabeth Born on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich Kent Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York . 7 Of the young Henrys six or seven siblings only three his brother Arthur Prince of Wales and sisters Margaret and Mary survived infancy. 8 He was baptised by Richard Foxe the Bishop of Exeter at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace. 9 In 1493 at the age of two Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports . He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after. The day after the ceremony he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches . In May 1495 he was appointed to the Order of the Garter . The reason for giving such appointments to a small child was to enable his father to retain personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families. 9 Not much is known about Henrys early life save for his appointments because he was not expected to become king 9 but it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors. He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian. 10 11 In November 1501 Henry played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother Arthurs marriage to Catherine the youngest child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile . 12 As Duke of York Henry used the arms of his father as king differenced by a label of three points ermine . He was further honoured on 9 February 1506 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I who made him a Knight of the Golden Fleece . 13 In 1502 Arthur died at the age of 15 just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine. 14 Arthurs death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother. The 10-year-old Henry became the new Duke of Cornwall and the new Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in February 1504. 15 Henry VII gave his second son few responsibilities even after the death of Arthur. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result he ascended the throne untrained in the exacting art of kingship . 16 Henry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain by offering his son Henry in marriage to the widowed Catherine. 14 Henry VII and Queen Isabella were both keen on the idea which had arisen very shortly after Arthurs death. 17 On 23 June 1503 a treaty was signed for their marriage and they were betrothed two days later. 18 A papal dispensation was only needed for the impediment of public honesty if the marriage had not been consummated as Catherine and her duenna claimed but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for affinity which took account of the possibility of consummation. 18 Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young. 17 Isabellas death in 1504 and the ensuing problems of succession in Castile complicated matters. Ferdinand II preferred Catherine to stay in England but Henry VIIs relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated. 19 Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time culminating in Prince Henrys rejection of the marriage as soon he was able at the age of 14. Ferdinands solution was to make his daughter ambassador allowing her to stay in England indefinitely. Devout she began to believe that it was Gods will that she marry the prince despite his opposition. 20 Early reign Portrait by Meynnart Wewyck 1509 Henry VII died in April 1509 and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king. 21 Soon after his fathers burial on 10 May Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the marriage portion . 18 22 The new king maintained that it had been his fathers dying wish that he marry Catherine. 20 Whether or not this was true it was convenient. Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter Eleanor Catherines niece to Henry; she had now been jilted. 23 Henrys wedding to Catherine was kept low-key and was held at the friars church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509. 22 Henry claimed descent from Constantine the Great and King Arthur and saw himself as their successor. 24 On 23 June 1509 Henry led the now 23-year-old Catherine from the Tower of London to Westminster Abbey for their coronation which took place the following day. 25 It was a grand affair: the Kings passage was lined with tapestries and laid with fine cloth. 25 Following the ceremony there was a grand banquet in Westminster Hall . 26 As Catherine wrote to her father our time is spent in continuous festival . 22 Two days after his coronation Henry arrested his fathers two most unpopular ministers Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley . They were charged with high treason and were executed in 1510. Politically motivated executions would remain one of Henrys primary tactics for dealing with those who stood in his way. 7 Henry returned some of the money supposedly extorted by the two ministers. 27 By contrast Henrys view of the House of York potential rival claimants for the throne was more moderate than his fathers had been. Several who had been imprisoned by his father including Thomas Grey 2nd Marquess of Dorset were pardoned. 28 Others went unreconciled; Edmund de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513 an execution prompted by his brother Richard siding against the King. 29 Soon after marrying Henry Catherine conceived. She gave birth to a stillborn girl on 31 January 1510. About four months later Catherine again became pregnant. 30 On 1 January 1511 New Years Day a son Henry was born. After the grief of losing their first child the couple were pleased to have a boy and festivities were held 31 including a two-day joust known as the Westminster Tournament . However the child died seven weeks later. 30 Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1513 and 1515 but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl Mary . Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained but they eased slightly after Marys birth. 32 Although Henrys marriage to Catherine has since been described as unusually good 33 it is known that Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of Edward Stafford 3rd Duke of Buckingham either Elizabeth or Anne Hastings Countess of Huntingdon . 34 The most significant mistress for about three years starting in 1516 was Elizabeth Blount . 32 Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses considered by some to be few for a virile young king. 35 36 Exactly how many Henry had is disputed: David Loades believes Henry had mistresses only to a very limited extent 36 whilst Alison Weir believes there were numerous other affairs. 37 Catherine is not known to have protested. In 1518 she fell pregnant again with another girl who was also stillborn. 32 Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henrys illegitimate son Henry FitzRoy . 32 The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation. 38 FitzRoy married Mary Howard in 1533 but died childless three years later. 39 At the time of his death in July 1536 Parliament was considering the Second Succession Act which could have allowed him to become king. 40 France and the Habsburgs The meeting of Francis I and Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 In 1510 France with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the League of Cambrai was winning a war against Venice. Henry renewed his fathers friendship with Louis XII of France an issue that divided his council. Certainly war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult. 41 Shortly thereafter however Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand II of Aragon. After Pope Julius II created the anti-French Holy League in October 1511 41 Henry followed Ferdinands lead and brought England into the new League. An initial joint Anglo-Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England the start of making Henrys dreams of ruling France a reality. 42 The attack however following a formal declaration of war in April 1512 was not led by Henry personally 43 and was a considerable failure; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends and it strained the Anglo-Spanish alliance. Nevertheless the French were pushed out of Italy soon after and the alliance survived with both parties keen to win further victories over the French. 43 44 Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing Emperor Maximilian to join the Holy League. 45 Remarkably Henry had secured the promised title of Most Christian King of France from Julius and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris if only Louis could be defeated. 46 Henry with Emperor Charles V right and Pope Leo X centre c. 1520 On 30 June 1513 Henry invaded France and his troops defeated a French army at the Battle of the Spurs a relatively minor result but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after the English took Therouanne and handed it over to Maximilian; Tournai a more significant settlement followed. 47 Henry had led the army personally complete with a large entourage. 48 His absence from the country however had prompted his brother-in-law James IV of Scotland to invade England at the behest of Louis. 49 Nevertheless the English army overseen by Queen Catherine decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. 50 Among the dead was the Scottish King thus ending Scotlands brief involvement in the war. 50 These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired. However despite initial indications he decided not to pursue a 1514 campaign. He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return; Englands coffers were now empty. 51 With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France Henry signed his own treaty with Louis: his sister Mary would become Louiss wife having previously been pledged to the younger Charles and peace was secured for eight years a remarkably long time. 52 Charles V the nephew of Henrys wife Catherine inherited a large empire in Europe becoming king of Spain in 1516 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. When Louis XII of France died in 1515 he was succeeded by his cousin Francis I . 53 These accessions left three relatively young rulers and an opportunity for a clean slate. The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518 aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe in the wake of a new Ottoman threat and it seemed that peace might be secured. 54 Henry met King Francis on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London however and conflict was inevitable. 54 Henry had more in common with Charles whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought his realm into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France but sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy then a territorial possession of Charles and the continued support of the Emperor. 55 A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Sensing this Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525. 56 Marriages Main article: Wives of Henry VIII v t e Family tree of the wives of Henry VIII King Henry VIII and all six of his wives were related through a common ancestor King Edward I of England . 57 12391307 Edward I King of England r. 12721307 b. 1275 Margaret Duchess of Brabant c. 1282 1316 Elizabeth Countess of Hereford 12841327 Edward II King of England r. 13071327 13001355 John III Duke of Brabant 13121360 William de Bohun Earl of Northampton 13121377 Edward III King of England r. 13271377 13231380 Margaret of Brabant Countess of Flanders 13381368 Lionel of Antwerp Duke of Clarence 13401399 John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster 13501405 Margaret III Countess of Flanders 58 c. 1350 1385 Elizabeth Fitzalan Countess of Arundel 13551382 Philippa Countess of Ulster 13711419 John Duke of Burgundy 13661425 Elizabeth Fitzalan Duchess of Norfolk 13711417 Elizabeth Mortimer 13741398 Roger Mortimer Earl of March c. 1371 1410 John Beaufort Earl of Somerset 13731418 Catherine Queen of Castile c. 1379 1440 Joan Beaufort Countess of Westmorland 13931466 Mary Duchess of Cleves b. 1388 Margaret de Mowbray c. 1395 1436 Elizabeth Baroness de Clifford 1388 c. 1411 Anne de Mortimer 14041444 John Beaufort Duke of Somerset 14051454 John II King of Castile 14001460 Richard Neville Earl of Salisbury 14191481 John I Duke of Cleves c. 1425 1485 John Howard Duke of Norfolk Mary Clifford 14111460 Richard Duke of York b. c. 1430 Alice Neville Baroness FitzHugh of Ravensworth 14581521 John II Duke of Cleves 14431524 Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk c. 1448 14991501 Henry Wentworth 14421483 Edward IV King of England r. 14611470 r. 14701483 1441431509 Margaret Beaufort 14511504 Isabella I Queen of Castile c. 14551465 bef. 1507 Elizabeth FitzHugh Lady Parr of Kendal 149015381539 John III Duke of Cleves 59 c. 1478 1539 Edmund Howard c. 1480 1538 Elizabeth Boleyn Countess of Wiltshire c. 1478 1550 Margery Wentworth 14661503 Elizabeth of York 14571509 Henry VII King of England r. 14851509 c. 1483 1517 Sir Thomas Parr 15151557 Anne of Cleves 4th wife: 1540 c. 15241542 Catherine Howard 5th wife: 15401542 c. 1507 1536 Anne Boleyn 2nd wife: 15331536 c. 1508 1537 Jane Seymour 3rd wife: 15361537 14911547 Henry VIII King of England r. 15091547 14851536 Catherine of Aragon 1st wife: 15091533 15121548 Catherine Parr 6th wife: 15431547 15331603 Elizabeth I Queen of England r. 15581603 15371553 Edward VI King of England r. 15471553 15161558 Mary I Queen of England r. 15531558 Annulment from Catherine Catherine of Aragon Henrys first queen c. 1520 Portrait of Henry VIII by Joos van Cleve c. 1531 During his marriage to Catherine of Aragon Henry conducted an affair with Mary Boleyn Catherines lady-in-waiting . There has been speculation that Marys two children Henry Carey and Catherine Carey were fathered by Henry but this has never been proven. King Henry never acknowledged them as he did in the case of Henry FitzRoy. 60 In 1525 as Henry grew more impatient with Catherines inability to produce the male heir he desired 61 62 he became enamoured of Mary Boleyns sister Anne Boleyn then a charismatic young woman of 25 in the Queens entourage. 63 Anne however resisted his attempts to seduce her and refused to become his mistress as her sister had. 64 b It was in this context that Henry considered his three options for finding a dynastic successor and hence resolving what came to be described at court as the Kings great matter . These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy which would need the involvement of the Pope and would be open to challenge; marrying off Mary his daughter with Catherine as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henrys death or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child-bearing age. Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34-year-old Henry 66 and it soon became the Kings absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40-year-old Catherine. 67 Henrys precise motivations and intentions over the coming years are not widely agreed on. 68 Henry himself at least in the early part of his reign was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication Assertio Septem Sacramentorum Defence of the Seven Sacraments earned him the title of Fidei Defensor Defender of the Faith from Pope Leo X. 69 The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms. 69 It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly by 1527 he had convinced himself that Catherine had produced no male heir because their union was blighted in the eyes of God . 70 Indeed in marrying Catherine his brothers wife he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20:21 a justification Thomas Cranmer used to declare the marriage null. 71 c Martin Luther on the other hand had initially argued against the annulment stating that Henry VIII could take a second wife in accordance with his teaching that the Bible allowed for polygamy but not divorce . 71 Henry now believed the Pope had lacked the authority to grant a dispensation from this impediment. It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack. 68 In going public all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost. 72 Henry sent his secretary William Knight to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull. Knight was unsuccessful; the Pope could not be misled so easily. 73 Other missions concentrated on arranging an ecclesiastical court to meet in England with a representative from Clement VII. Although Clement agreed to the creation of such a court he never had any intention of empowering his legate Lorenzo Campeggio to decide in Henrys favour. 73 This bias was perhaps the result of pressure from Emperor Charles V Catherines nephew but it is not clear how far this influenced either Campeggio or the Pope. After less than two months of hearing evidence Clement called the case back to Rome in July 1529 from which it was clear that it would never re-emerge. 73 With the chance for an annulment lost Cardinal Wolsey bore the blame. He was charged with praemunire in October 1529 74 and his fall from grace was sudden and total . 73 Briefly reconciled with Henry and officially pardoned in the first half of 1530 he was charged once more in November 1530 this time for treason but died while awaiting trial. 73 75 After a short period in which Henry took government upon his own shoulders 76 Thomas More took on the role of Lord Chancellor and chief minister. Intelligent and able but a devout Catholic and opponent of the annulment 77 More initially cooperated with the Kings new policy denouncing Wolsey in Parliament. 78 A year later Catherine was banished from court and her rooms were given to Anne Boleyn . Anne was an unusually educated and intellectual woman for her time and was keenly absorbed and engaged with the ideas of the Protestant Reformers but the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. 65 When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died Annes influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. 77 This was approved by the Pope unaware of the Kings nascent plans for the Church. 79 Henry was married to Catherine for 24 years. Their divorce has been described as a deeply wounding and isolating experience for Henry. 4 Marriage to Anne Boleyn See also: Henry VIII Reformation Portrait of Anne Boleyn Henrys second queen; a copy of a lost original painted around 1534. In the winter of 1532 Henry met with Francis I at Calais and enlisted Franciss support for his new marriage. 80 Immediately upon returning to Dover in England Henry now 41 and Anne went through a secret wedding service. 81 She soon became pregnant and there was a second wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533 Cranmer sitting in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the Kings marriage to Catherine of Aragon declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later on 28 May 1533 Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be valid. 82 Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen becoming instead princess dowager as the widow of Arthur. In her place Anne was crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533. 83 The Queen gave birth to a daughter slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. The child was christened Elizabeth in honour of Henrys mother Elizabeth of York. 84 Following the marriage there was a period of consolidation taking the form of a series of statutes of the Reformation Parliament aimed at finding solutions to any remaining issues whilst protecting the new reforms from challenge convincing the public of their legitimacy and exposing and dealing with opponents. 85 Although the canon law was dealt with at length by Cranmer and others these acts were advanced by Thomas Cromwell Thomas Audley and the Duke of Norfolk and indeed by Henry himself. 86 With this process complete in May 1532 More resigned as Lord Chancellor leaving Cromwell as Henrys chief minister. 87 With the Act of Succession 1533 Catherines daughter Mary was declared illegitimate; Henrys marriage to Anne was declared legitimate; and Annes issue declared to be next in the line of succession. 88 With the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 Parliament recognised the Kings status as head of the church in England and together with the Act in Restraint of Appeals in 1532 abolished the right of appeal to Rome. 89 It was only then that Pope Clement VII took the step of excommunicating the King and Cranmer although the excommunication was not made official until some time later. d The King and Queen were not pleased with married life. The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection but Anne refused to play the submissive role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part Henry disliked Annes constant irritability and violent temper. After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534 he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534 Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine. 96 Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with Madge Shelton in 1535 although historian Antonia Fraser argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister Mary Shelton . 35 Opposition to Henrys religious policies was at first quickly suppressed in England. Some dissenting monks including the first Carthusian Martyrs were executed and many more pilloried . The most prominent resisters included John Fisher Bishop of Rochester and Thomas More both of whom refused to take the oath to the King. 97 Neither Henry nor Cromwell sought at that stage to have the men executed; rather they hoped that the two might change their minds and save themselves. Fisher openly rejected Henry as the Supreme Head of the Church but More was careful to avoid openly breaking the Treasons Act 1534 which unlike later acts did not forbid mere silence. Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason however More on the evidence of a single conversation with Richard Rich the Solicitor General - and both were executed in the summer of 1535. 97 These suppressions as well as the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 in turn contributed to a more general resistance to Henrys reforms most notably in the Pilgrimage of Grace a large uprising in northern England in October 1536. 98 Some 20 000 to 40 000 rebels were led by Robert Aske together with parts of the northern nobility. 99 Henry VIII promised the rebels he would pardon them and thanked them for raising the issues. Aske told the rebels they had been successful and they could disperse and go home. 100 Henry saw the rebels as traitors and did not feel obliged to keep his promises to them so when further violence occurred after Henrys offer of a pardon he was quick to break his promise of clemency. 101 The leaders including Aske were arrested and executed for treason. In total about 200 rebels were executed and the disturbances ended. 102 Execution of Anne Boleyn Portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger c. 1537 On 8 January 1536 news reached the King and Queen that Catherine of Aragon had died. The following day Henry dressed all in yellow with a white feather in his bonnet. 103 Queen Anne was pregnant again and she was aware that there might be consequences if she failed to give birth to a son. Later that month the King was thrown from his horse in a tournament and was badly injured; it seemed for a time that his life was in danger. When news of this accident reached the Queen she was sent into shock and miscarried a male child at about 15 weeks gestation on the day of Catherines funeral 29 January 1536. 104 For most observers this personal loss was the beginning of the end of this royal marriage. 105 Although the Boleyn family still held important positions on the Privy Council Anne had many enemies including the Duke of Suffolk . Even her own uncle the Duke of Norfolk had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally but the Kings favour had swung towards the latter partly because of Cromwell damaging the familys influence. 106 Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary among them the former supporters of Catherine who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility although it is commonly believed that it was Cromwells anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of having her executed. 107 108 Annes downfall came shortly after she had recovered from her final miscarriage. Whether it was primarily the result of allegations of conspiracy adultery or witchcraft remains a matter of debate among historians. 65 Early signs of a fall from grace included the Kings new mistress the 28-year-old Jane Seymour being moved into new quarters 109 and Annes brother George Boleyn being refused the Order of the Garter which was instead given to Nicholas Carew . 110 Between 30 April and 2 May five men including George Boleyn were arrested on charges of treasonable adultery and accused of having sexual relationships with the Queen. Anne was arrested accused of treasonous adultery and incest. Although the evidence against them was unconvincing the accused were found guilty and condemned to death. On 17 May 1536 Henry and Annes marriage was annulled by Archbishop Cranmer at Lambeth and the accused men were executed. 111 112 Cranmer appears to have had difficulty finding grounds for an annulment and probably based it on the prior liaison between Henry and Annes sister Mary which in canon law meant that Henrys marriage to Anne was like his first marriage within a forbidden degree of affinity and therefore void. 113 At 8 am on 19 May 1536 Anne was executed on Tower Green . 114 Marriage to Jane Seymour; domestic and foreign affairs Jane Seymour left became Henrys third wife pictured at right with Henry and the young Prince Edward c. 1545 by an unknown artist. At the time that this was painted Henry was married to his sixth wife Catherine Parr . The day after Annes execution the 45-year-old Henry became engaged to Seymour who had been one of the Queens ladies-in-waiting . They were married ten days later 115 at the Palace of Whitehall Whitehall London in Annes closet by Stephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester . 116 With Charles V distracted by the internal politics of his many kingdoms and external threats and Henry and Francis on relatively good terms domestic and not foreign policy issues had been Henrys priority in the first half of the 1530s. In 1536 for example Henry granted his assent to the Laws in Wales Act 1535 which legally annexed Wales uniting England and Wales into a single nation. This was followed by the Second Succession Act the Succession to the Crown Act 1536 which declared Henrys children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate thus excluding them from the throne. The King was granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his will should he have no further issue. 117 On 12 October 1537 Jane gave birth to a son Prince Edward the future Edward VI . 118 The birth was difficult and Queen Jane died on 24 October 1537 from an infection and was buried in Windsor. 119 The euphoria that had accompanied Edwards birth became sorrow but it was only over time that Henry came to long for his wife. At the time Henry recovered quickly from the shock. 120 Measures were immediately put in place to find another wife for Henry which at the insistence of Cromwell and the Privy Council were focused on the European continent. 121 In 1538 as part of the negotiation of a secret treaty by Cromwell with Charles V a series of dynastic marriages were proposed: Mary would marry a son of King John III of Portugal Elizabeth would marry one of the sons of King Ferdinand I of Hungary and the infant Edward would marry one of Charless daughters. It was suggested the widowed Henry might marry Christina Dowager Duchess of Milan . 122 However when Charles and Francis made peace in January 1539 Henry became increasingly paranoid perhaps as a result of receiving a constant list of threats to the kingdom real or imaginary minor or serious supplied by Cromwell in his role as spymaster. 123 Enriched by the dissolution of the monasteries Henry used some of his financial reserves to build a series of coastal defences and set some aside for use in the event of a Franco-German invasion. 124 Marriage to Anne of Cleves Portrait of Anne of Cleves by Hans Holbein the Younger 1539 Having considered the matter Cromwell suggested Anne the 25-year-old sister of the Duke of Cleves who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England for the Duke fell between Lutheranism and Catholicism . 125 Other potential brides included Christina of Denmark Anna of Lorraine Louise of Guise and Amalia of Cleves . Hans Holbein the Younger was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the King. 126 Despite speculation that Holbein painted her in an overly flattering light it is more likely that the portrait was accurate; Holbein remained in favour at court. 127 After seeing Holbeins portrait and urged on by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers the 49-year-old King agreed to wed Anne. 128 When Henry met Anne however he was much displeased with her appearance. The King was reportedly taken aback and told his courtiers I promise you I see no such thing as hath been shown me of her by pictures and report. I am ashamed that men have praised her as they have done and I love her not! 37 Despite his protests Henry knew that the situation was too far gone and he would have to wed his bride. The marriage took place in January 1540 but it was never consummated. The morning after their wedding night Henry complained about his new wife to Cromwell stating: 129 Surely my lord I liked her before not well but now I like her much worse! She is nothing fair and have very evil smells about her. I took her to be no maid by reason of the closeness of her breasts and other tokens which when I felt them strake me so to the heart that I had neither will nor courage to prove the rest. I can have none appetite for displeasant airs. I have left her as good a maid and I found her. Henry wished to annul the marriage as soon as possible so he could marry another. 130 131 Anne did not argue and confirmed that the marriage had never been consummated. 132 Annes previous betrothal to Francis of Lorraine provided further grounds for the annulment. 133 The marriage was subsequently dissolved in July 1540 and Anne received the title of The Kings Sister two houses and a generous allowance. 132 Marriage to Catherine Howard and fall of Thomas Cromwell Portrait of a woman believed to be Catherine Howard Henrys fifth wife by Hans Holbein the Younger 1540 It was soon clear that Henry had fallen for the 17-year-old Catherine Howard the Duke of Norfolks niece. This worried Cromwell for Norfolk was his political opponent. 134 Shortly after the religious reformers and proteges of Cromwell Robert Barnes William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics. 132 Cromwell meanwhile fell out of favour although it is unclear exactly why for there is little evidence of differences in domestic or foreign policy. Despite his role he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henrys failed marriage. 135 Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece Catherines position. 134 Cromwell was charged with treason selling export licences granting passports and drawing up commissions without permission and may also have been blamed for the failure of the foreign policy that accompanied the attempted marriage to Anne. 136 137 He was subsequently attainted and beheaded. 135 On 28 July 1540 the same day Cromwell was executed Henry married the young Catherine Howard a first cousin and lady-in-waiting of Anne Boleyn. 138 He was delighted with his new queen and awarded her the lands of Cromwell and a vast array of jewellery. 139 Soon after the marriage however Queen Catherine had an affair with the courtier Thomas Culpeper . She also employed Francis Dereham who had previously been informally engaged to her and had an affair with her prior to her marriage as her secretary. The Privy Council was informed of her affair with Dereham whilst Henry was away; Thomas Cranmer was dispatched to investigate and he brought evidence of Queen Catherines previous affair with Dereham to the Kings notice. 140 Though Henry originally refused to believe the allegations Dereham confessed. It took another meeting of the council however before Henry believed the accusations against Dereham and went into a rage blaming the council before consoling himself in hunting. 141 When questioned the Queen could have admitted a prior contract to marry Dereham which would have made her subsequent marriage to Henry invalid but she instead claimed that Dereham had forced her to enter into an adulterous relationship. Dereham meanwhile exposed Catherines relationship with Culpeper. Culpeper and Dereham were both executed and Catherine too was beheaded on 13 February 1542. 142 Marriage to Catherine Parr Catherine Parr Henrys sixth and last wife Henry married his last wife the wealthy widow Catherine Parr in July 1543. 143 A reformer at heart she argued with Henry over religion. Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood that had gained ground after Cromwells fall had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it. 144 Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters Mary and Elizabeth. 145 In 1543 the Third Succession Act put them back in the line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will. 146 Shrines destroyed and monasteries dissolved Main article: Dissolution of the monasteries In 1538 the chief minister Thomas Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what the government termed idolatry practised under the old religion culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral . As a consequence the King was excommunicated by Pope Paul III on 17 December of the same year. 94 In 1540 Henry sanctioned the complete destruction of shrines to saints. In 1542 Englands remaining monasteries were all dissolved and their property transferred to the Crown. Abbots and priors lost their seats in the House of Lords . Consequently the Lords Spiritual as members of the clergy with seats in the House of Lords were known were for the first time outnumbered by the Lords Temporal . 147 Second invasion of France and the Rough Wooing of Scotland Main article: Rough Wooing Henry in 1540 by Hans Holbein the Younger The 1539 alliance between Francis and Charles had soured eventually degenerating into renewed war. With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the Italian War in favour of his new ally. An invasion of France was planned for 1543. 148 In preparation for it Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under his young nephew James V . The Scots were defeated at Battle of Solway Moss on 24 November 1542 149 and James died on 15 December. Henry now hoped to unite the crowns of England and Scotland by marrying his son Edward to Jamess successor Mary . The Scottish regent Lord Arran agreed to the marriage in the Treaty of Greenwich on 1 July 1543 but it was rejected by the Parliament of Scotland on 11 December. The result was eight years of war between England and Scotland a campaign later dubbed the Rough Wooing . Despite several peace treaties unrest continued in Scotland until Henrys death. 150 151 152 Despite the early success with Scotland Henry hesitated to invade France annoying Charles. Henry finally went to France in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged Montreuil . The other under Suffolk laid siege to Boulogne . Henry later took personal command and Boulogne fell on 18 September 1544. 153 150 However Henry had refused Charless request to march against Paris. Charless own campaign fizzled and he made peace with France that same day. 151 Henry was left alone against France unable to make peace. Francis attempted to invade England in the summer of 1545 but his forces reached only the Isle of Wight before being repulsed in the Battle of the Solent . Financially exhausted France and England signed the Treaty of Camp on 7 June 1546. Henry secured Boulogne for eight years. The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns 750 000. Henry needed the money; the 1544 campaign had cost 650 000 and England was once again facing bankruptcy. 151 Physical decline and death Coffins of King Henry VIII centre damaged Queen Jane right King Charles I with a child of Queen Anne left vault under the choir St Georges Chapel Windsor Castle marked by a stone slab in the floor. 1888 sketch by Alfred Young Nutt Surveyor to the Dean and Canons Late in life Henry became obese with a waist measurement of 54 inches 140 cm and had to be moved about with the help of mechanical devices. He was covered with painful pus -filled boils and possibly had gout . His obesity and other medical problems can be traced to the jousting accident on 24 January 1536 in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident reopened and aggravated an injury he had sustained years earlier to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The chronic wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henrys mood swings which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament. 154 155 156 This suit of armour was commissioned about 1544 when Henrys midsection had a girth of 51 inches The theory that Henry had syphilis has been dismissed by most historians. 157 158 Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to scurvy which is caused by insufficient vitamin C most often due to a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in ones diet. 159 A 2010 study suggests that the king may have been of Kell-positive blood type to explain both his physical and mental deterioration being consistent with some symptoms of the McLeod syndrome and the high mortality in the pregnancies attributed to him. 160 161 Henrys obesity hastened his death at the age of 55 on 28 January 1547 in the Palace of Whitehall on what would have been his fathers 90th birthday. The tomb he had planned with components taken from the tomb intended for Cardinal Wolsey was only partly constructed and was never completed the sarcophagus and its base were later removed and used for Lord Nelson s tomb in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral . 162 Henry was interred in a vault at St Georges Chapel Windsor Castle next to Jane Seymour. 163 Over 100 years later King Charles I ruled 16251649 was buried in the same vault. 164 Wives mistresses and children See also: Wives of Henry VIII Children of Henry VIII and Mistresses of Henry VIII English historian and House of Tudor expert David Starkey describes Henry VIII as follows: What is extraordinary is that Henry was usually a very good husband. And he liked women thats why he married so many of them! He was very tender to them we know that he addressed them as sweetheart . He was a good lover he was very generous: the wives were given huge settlements of land and jewels they were loaded with jewels. He was immensely considerate when they were pregnant. But once he had fallen out of love... he just cut them off. He just withdrew. He abandoned them. They didnt even know hed left them. 4 Known children of Henry VIII of England Name Birth Death Notes By Catherine of Aragon married Palace of Placentia 11 June 1509; annulled 23 May 1533 Unnamed daughter 31 January 1510 stillborn Henry Duke of Cornwall 1 January 1511 22 February 1511 died aged almost two months Unnamed son 17 September 1513 died shortly after birth Unnamed son November 1514 165 died shortly after birth Queen Mary I 18 February 1516 17 November 1558 married Philip II of Spain in 1554; no issue Unnamed daughter 10 November 1518 stillborn in the 8th month of pregnancy 166 or lived at least one week By Elizabeth Blount mistress; bore the only illegitimate child Henry VIII acknowledged as his son Henry FitzRoy 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset 15 June 1519 23 July 1536 illegitimate; acknowledged by Henry VIII in 1525; no issue By Anne Boleyn married Westminster Abbey 25 January 1533; annulled 17 May 1536 beheaded 19 May 1536 Queen Elizabeth I 7 September 1533 24 March 1603 never married; no issue Unnamed son Christmas 1534 96 miscarriage or false pregnancy e Unnamed son 1535 miscarried son f Unnamed son 29 January 1536 miscarriage of a child believed male g in the fourth month of pregnancy 167 By Jane Seymour married Palace of Whitehall 30 May 1536 died 24 October 1537 King Edward VI 12 October 1537 6 July 1553 died unmarried age 15; no issue By Anne of Cleves married Palace of Placentia 6 January 1540 annulled 9 July 1540 no issue By Catherine Howard married Oatlands Palace 28 July 1540; annulled 23 November 1541 beheaded 13 February 1542 no issue By Catherine Parr married Hampton Court Palace 12 July 1543 Henry VIII died 28 January 1547 no issue Succession See also: Third Succession Act All of Henrys surviving children succeeded him as monarchs Edward VI r. 15471553 Mary I r. 15531558 Elizabeth I r. 15581603 Upon Henrys death he was succeeded by his only surviving son Edward VI . Since Edward was then only nine years old he could not rule directly. Instead Henrys will designated 16 executors to serve on a regency council until Edward reached 18. The executors chose Edward Seymour 1st Earl of Hertford elder brother to Jane Seymour Edwards mother to be Lord Protector of the Realm. Under provisions of the will if Edward died childless the throne was to pass to Mary Henry VIIIs daughter by Catherine of Aragon and her heirs. If Marys issue failed the crown was to go to Elizabeth Henrys daughter by Anne Boleyn and her heirs. Finally if Elizabeths line became extinct the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIIIs deceased younger sister Mary the Greys . The descendants of Henrys sister Margaret Tudor the Stuarts rulers of Scotland were thereby excluded from the succession. 168 This provision ultimately failed when James VI of Scotland Margarets great-grandson became King of England in 1603. Edward VI himself would disregard the will and name Jane Grey his successor. Public image Musical score of Pastime with Good Company c. 1513 composed by Henry Henry cultivated the image of a Renaissance man and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess epitomised by the Field of the Cloth of Gold . He scouted the country for choirboys taking some directly from Wolseys choir and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis Richard Sampson Ambrose Lupo and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo 169 and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments. He was skilled on the lute and played the organ and was a talented player of the virginals . 169 He could also sightread music and sing well. 169 He was an accomplished musician author and poet; his best-known piece of music is Pastime with Good Company The Kynges Ballade and he is reputed to have written Greensleeves but probably did not. 170 Henry was an avid gambler and dice player and excelled at sports especially jousting hunting and real tennis . He was also known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety. 8 He was involved in the construction and improvement of several significant buildings including Nonsuch Palace Kings College Chapel Cambridge and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings which he improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey such as Christ Church Oxford Hampton Court Palace the Palace of Whitehall and Trinity College Cambridge . Henry was an intellectual the first English king with a modern humanist education. He read and wrote English French and Latin and owned a large library. He annotated many books and published one of his own and he had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared to support the reformation of the church. Richard Sampsons Oratio 1534 for example was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent of Rome. 171 At the popular level theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices; the Pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils while Henry was hailed as the glorious King of England and as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. 172 Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power. 173 Catherine of Aragon watching Henry jousting in her honour after giving birth to a son Henry was a large well-built athlete over 6 feet 1.8 m tall strong and broad in proportion. His athletic activities were more than pastimes; they were political devices that served multiple goals enhancing his image impressing foreign emissaries and rulers and conveying his ability to suppress any rebellion. He arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517 where he wore gilded armour and gilded horse trappings and outfits of velvet satin and cloth of gold with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors one of whom wrote home that the wealth and civilisation of the world are here and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such . 174 Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started gaining weight and lost the trim athletic figure that had made him so handsome and his courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate and flatter him. His health rapidly declined near the end of his reign. 175 176 177 Government The power of Tudor monarchs including Henry was whole and entire ruling as they claimed by the grace of God alone. 178 The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative . These included acts of diplomacy including royal marriages declarations of war management of the coinage the issue of royal pardons and the power to summon and dissolve Parliament as and when required. 179 Nevertheless as evident during Henrys break with Rome the monarch stayed within established limits whether legal or financial that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and Parliament representing the gentry. 179 Cardinal Thomas Wolsey In practice Tudor monarchs used patronage to maintain a royal court that included formal institutions such as the Privy Council as well as more informal advisers and confidants. 180 Both the rise and fall of court nobles could be swift: Henry did undoubtedly execute at will burning or beheading two of his wives 20 peers four leading public servants six close attendants and friends one cardinal John Fisher and numerous abbots. 173 Among those who were in favour at any given point in Henrys reign one could usually be identified as a chief minister 180 though one of the enduring debates in the historiography of the period has been the extent to which those chief ministers controlled Henry rather than vice versa. 181 In particular historian G. R. Elton has argued that one such minister Thomas Cromwell led a Tudor revolution in government independently of the King whom Elton presented as an opportunistic essentially lazy participant in the nitty-gritty of politics. Where Henry did intervene personally in the running of the country Elton argued he mostly did so to its detriment. 182 The prominence and influence of faction in Henrys court is similarly discussed in the context of at least five episodes of Henrys reign including the downfall of Anne Boleyn. 183 From 1514 to 1529 Thomas Wolsey a cardinal of the established Church oversaw domestic and foreign policy for the King from his position as Lord Chancellor. 184 Wolsey centralised the national government and extended the jurisdiction of the conciliar courts particularly the Star Chamber . The Star Chambers overall structure remained unchanged but Wolsey used it to provide much-needed reform of the criminal law. The power of the court itself did not outlive Wolsey however since no serious administrative reform was undertaken and its role eventually devolved to the localities. 185 Wolsey helped fill the gap left by Henrys declining participation in government particularly in comparison to his father but did so mostly by imposing himself in the Kings place. 186 His use of these courts to pursue personal grievances and particularly to treat delinquents as mere examples of a whole class worthy of punishment angered the rich who were annoyed as well by his enormous wealth and ostentatious living. 187 Following Wolseys downfall Henry took full control of his government although at court numerous complex factions continued to try to ruin and destroy each other. 188 Thomas Cromwell in 1532 or 1533 Thomas Cromwell also came to define Henrys government. Returning to England from the continent in 1514 or 1515 Cromwell soon entered Wolseys service. He turned to law also picking up a good knowledge of the Bible and was admitted to Grays Inn in 1524. He became Wolseys man of all work . 189 Driven in part by his religious beliefs Cromwell attempted to reform the body politic of the English government through discussion and consent and through the vehicle of continuity not outward change. 190 Many saw him as the man they wanted to bring about their shared aims including Thomas Audley. By 1531 Cromwell and his associates were already responsible for the drafting of much legislation. 190 Cromwells first office was that of the master of the Kings jewels in 1532 from which he began to invigorate the government finances. 191 By that point Cromwells power as an efficient administrator in a Council full of politicians exceeded what Wolsey had achieved. 192 Cromwell did much work through his many offices to remove the tasks of government from the Royal Household and ideologically from the personal body of the King and into a public state. 192 But he did so in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants not least because he needed to retain Henrys support his own power and the possibility of actually achieving the plan he set out. 193 Cromwell made the various income streams Henry VII put in place more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. 194 The role of the Kings Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor. 195 A difference emerged between the Kings financial health and the countrys although Cromwells fall undermined much of his bureaucracy which required him to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. 196 Cromwells reforms ground to a halt in 1539 the initiative lost and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539 . 197 He was executed on 28 July 1540. 198 Finances Gold crown of Henry VIII minted c. 1544 1547. The reverse depicts the quartered arms of England and France. Henry inherited a vast fortune and a prosperous economy from his father who had been frugal. This fortune is estimated at 1 250 000 the equivalent of 375 million today. 199 By comparison Henry VIIIs reign was a near disaster financially. He augmented the royal treasury by seizing church lands but his heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy. 200 Henry spent much of his wealth on maintaining his court and household including many of the building works he undertook on royal palaces. He hung 2 000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison James V of Scotland hung just 200 . 201 Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons which included exotic archery equipment 2 250 pieces of land ordnance and 6 500 handguns . 202 Tudor monarchs had to fund all government expenses out of their own income. This income came from the crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like tonnage and poundage granted by Parliament to the king for life. During Henrys reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant around 100 000 203 but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed war and Henrys dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s. Henry VII had not involved Parliament in his affairs very much but Henry VIII had to turn to Parliament during his reign for money in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The dissolution of the monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury and as a result the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth 120 000 36 million a year. 204 The Crown had profited by a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey put England onto a gold rather than silver standard and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant helping to bring income and expenditure together but it had a catastrophic effect on the countrys economy. In part it helped to bring about a period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards. 205 Reformation Main article: English Reformation King Henry VIII sitting with his feet upon Pope Clement VI 1641 Henry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed 206 and the precise narrative not widely agreed upon. 68 Certainly in 1527 Henry until then an observant and well-informed Catholic appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. 68 No annulment was immediately forthcoming since the papacy was now under the control of Charles V Catherines nephew. 207 The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henrys rejection of papal supremacy which he had previously defended. Yet as E. L. Woodward put it Henrys determination to annul his marriage with Catherine was the occasion rather than the cause of the English Reformation so that neither too much nor too little should be made of the annulment. 208 Historian A. F. Pollard has argued that even if Henry had not needed an annulment he might have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons. Indeed Henry needed a son to secure the Tudor Dynasty and avert the risk of civil war over disputed succession. 209 In any case between 1532 and 1537 Henry instituted a number of statutes that dealt with the relationship between king and pope and hence the structure of the nascent Church of England . 210 These included the Statute in Restraint of Appeals passed 1533 which extended the charge of praemunire against all who introduced papal bulls into England potentially exposing them to the death penalty if found guilty. 211 Other acts included the Supplication against the Ordinaries and the Submission of the Clergy which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church. The Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534 required the clergy to elect bishops nominated by the Sovereign. The Act of Supremacy in 1534 declared that the King was the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England and the Treasons Act 1534 made it high treason punishable by death to refuse the Oath of Supremacy acknowledging the King as such. Similarly following the passage of the Act of Succession 1533 all adults in the kingdom were required to acknowledge the Acts provisions declaring Henrys marriage to Anne legitimate and his marriage to Catherine illegitimate by oath; 212 those who refused were subject to imprisonment for life and any publisher or printer of any literature alleging that the marriage to Anne was invalid subject to the death penalty. 213 Finally the Peters Pence Act was passed and it reiterated that England had no superior under God but only your Grace and that Henrys imperial crown had been diminished by the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions of the Pope. 214 The King had much support from the Church under Cranmer. 215 A 16th-century depiction of the Parliament of King Henry VIII To Cromwells annoyance Henry insisted on parliamentary time to discuss questions of faith which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This led to the passing of the Act of Six Articles whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy thus restraining the reform movement in England. 131 It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed liturgy and of the Book of Common Prayer which would take until 1549 to complete. 216 But this victory for religious conservatives did not convert into much change in personnel and Cranmer remained in his position. 217 Overall the rest of Henrys reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority. Henry established a new political theology of obedience to the crown that continued for the next decade. It reflected Martin Luther s new interpretation of the fourth commandment Honour thy father and mother brought to England by William Tyndale . The founding of royal authority on the Ten Commandments was another important shift: reformers within the Church used the Commandments emphasis on faith and the word of God while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good. The reformers efforts lay behind the publication of the Great Bible in 1539 in English. 218 Protestant Reformers still faced persecution particularly over objections to Henrys annulment. Many fled abroad including the influential Tyndale 219 who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henrys behest. When taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Churchs extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium the Valor Ecclesiasticus . 220 In September 1535 Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focused almost exclusively on the countrys religious houses with largely negative conclusions. 221 In addition to reporting back to Cromwell the visitors made the lives of the monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution. 222 In any case the evidence Cromwell gathered led swiftly to the beginning of the state-enforced dissolution of the monasteries with all religious houses worth less than 200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536. 223 After a short pause surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and new owners and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained; 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient with minimal resistance and brought the crown some 90 000 a year. 224 The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed. 225 Cromwells actions transferred a fifth of Englands landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown which would use the lands much more efficiently. 226 Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in Englands religious houses they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform. 227 Response to the reforms was mixed. The religious houses had been the only support of the impoverished 228 and the reforms alienated much of the populace outside London helping to provoke the great northern rising of 153637 known as the Pilgrimage of Grace . 229 Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They reemerged during the reign of Henrys daughter Mary 155358. Military Henrys Italian-made suit of armour c. 1544 . Apart from permanent garrisons at Berwick Calais and Carlisle Englands standing army numbered only a few hundred men. This was increased only slightly by Henry. 230 Henrys invasion force of 1513 some 30 000 men was composed of billmen and longbowmen at a time when the other European nations were moving to hand guns and pikemen but the difference in capability was at this stage not significant and Henrys forces had new armour and weaponry. They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the war wagon 231 relatively new innovations and several large and expensive siege guns. 232 The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk which in the latter case produced disastrous results at Montreuil. 150 Henrys break with Rome incurred the threat of a large-scale French or Spanish invasion. 93 To guard against this in 1538 he began to build a chain of expensive state-of-the-art defences along Britains southern and eastern coasts from Kent to Cornwall largely built of material gained from the demolition of the monasteries . 233 These were known as Henry VIIIs Device Forts . He also strengthened existing coastal defence fortresses such as Dover Castle and at Dover Moat Bulwark and Archcliffe Fort which he visited for a few months to supervise. 93 Wolsey had many years before conducted the censuses required for an overhaul of the system of militia but no reform resulted. 234 In 153839 Cromwell overhauled the shire musters but his work mainly served to demonstrate how inadequate they were in organisation. 93 The building works including that at Berwick along with the reform of the militias and musters were eventually finished under Queen Mary. 235 Depiction of Henry embarking at Dover c. 1520 Henry is traditionally cited as one of the founders of the Royal Navy . 236 Technologically Henry invested in large cannon for his warships an idea that had taken hold in other countries to replace the smaller serpentines in use. 236 He also flirted with designing ships personally. His contribution to larger vessels if any is unknown but it is believed that he influenced the design of rowbarges and similar galleys. 237 Henry was also responsible for the creation of a permanent navy with the supporting anchorages and dockyards. 236 Tactically Henrys reign saw the Navy move away from boarding tactics to employ gunnery instead. 238 The Tudor navy was enlarged from seven ships to up to 50 239 the Mary Rose among them and Henry was responsible for the establishment of the council for marine causes to oversee the maintenance and operation of the Navy becoming the basis for the later Admiralty . 240 Ireland The division of Ireland in 1450 At the beginning of Henrys reign Ireland was effectively divided into three zones: the Pale where English rule was unchallenged; Leinster and Munster the so-called obedient land of Anglo-Irish peers; and the Gaelic Connaught and Ulster with merely nominal English rule. 241 Until 1513 Henry continued the policy of his father to allow Irish lords to rule in the Kings name and accept steep divisions between the communities. 242 However upon the death of the 8th Earl of Kildare governor of Ireland fractious Irish politics combined with a more ambitious Henry to cause trouble. When Thomas Butler 7th Earl of Ormond died Henry recognised one successor for Ormonds English Welsh and Scottish lands whilst in Ireland another took control. Kildares successor the 9th Earl was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by the Earl of Surrey in 1520. 243 Surreys ambitious aims were costly but ineffective; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy as favoured by Henry and Wolsey and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey. 244 Surrey was recalled in 1521 with Piers Butler one of the claimants to the Earldom of Ormond appointed in his place. Butler proved unable to control opposition including that of Kildare. Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524 resuming his dispute with Butler which had before been in a lull. Meanwhile the Earl of Desmond an Anglo-Irish peer had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him Kildare was once again removed from his post. 245 The Desmond situation was resolved on his death in 1529 which was followed by a period of uncertainty. This was effectively ended with the appointment of Henry FitzRoy Duke of Richmond and the Kings son as lord lieutenant. Richmond had never before visited Ireland his appointment a break with past policy. 246 247 For a time it looked as if peace might be restored with the return of Kildare to Ireland to manage the tribes but the effect was limited and the Irish Parliament soon rendered ineffective. 248 Ireland began to receive the attention of Cromwell who had supporters of Ormond and Desmond promoted. Kildare on the other hand was summoned to London; after some hesitation he departed for London in 1534 where he would face charges of treason. 248 His son Thomas Lord Offaly was more forthright denouncing the King and leading a Catholic crusade against Henry who was by this time mired in marital problems. Offaly had the Archbishop of Dublin murdered and besieged Dublin. Offaly led a mixture of Pale gentry and Irish tribes although he failed to secure the support of Lord Darcy a sympathiser or Charles V. What was effectively a civil war was ended with the intervention of 2 000 English troops a large army by Irish standards and the execution of Offaly his father was already dead and his uncles. 249 250 Although the Offaly revolt was followed by a determination to rule Ireland more closely Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Antony St Leger as Lord Deputy of Ireland who would remain in post past Henrys death. 251 Until the break with Rome it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king so in 1542 Henry asserted Englands claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship . This change did however also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henrys request was an accompanying barony and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords which was to run in parallel with Englands. 252 The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous and the plan was abandoned in 1543 not to be replaced. 253 Historiography The complexities and sheer scale of Henrys legacy ensured that in the words of Betteridge and Freeman throughout the centuries Henry has been praised and reviled but he has never been ignored . 181 In the 1950s historian John D. Mackie summed up Henrys personality and its impact on his achievements and popularity: The respect nay even the popularity which he had from his people was not unmerited.... He kept the development of England in line with some of the most vigorous though not the noblest forces of the day. His high courage highest when things went ill his commanding intellect his appreciation of fact and his instinct for rule carried his country through a perilous time of change and his very arrogance saved his people from the wars which afflicted other lands. Dimly remembering the wars of the Roses vaguely informed as to the slaughters and sufferings in Europe the people of England knew that in Henry they had a great king. 254 A particular focus of modern historiography has been the extent to which the events of Henrys life including his marriages foreign policy and religious changes were the result of his own initiative and if they were whether they were the result of opportunism or of a principled undertaking by Henry. 181 The traditional interpretation of those events was provided by historian A. F. Pollard who in 1902 presented his own largely positive view of the King lauding him as the King and statesman who whatever his personal failings led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire . 181 Pollards interpretation remained the dominant interpretation of Henrys life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G. R. Elton in 1953. Eltons 1977 book on The Tudor Revolution in Government maintained Pollards positive interpretation of the Henrician period as a whole but reinterpreted Henry himself as a follower rather than a leader. For Elton it was Cromwell and not Henry who undertook the changes in government Henry was shrewd but lacked the vision to follow a complex plan through. 181 Henry was little more in other words than an ego-centric monstrosity whose reign owed its successes and virtues to better and greater men about him; most of its horrors and failures sprang more directly from the King . 255 Although the central tenets of Eltons thesis have since been questioned it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work including that of J. J. Scarisbrick his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Eltons regard for Cromwells abilities but returned agency to Henry who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy. 181 For Scarisbrick Henry was a formidable captivating man who wore regality with a splendid conviction . 256 The effect of endowing Henry with this ability however was largely negative in Scarisbricks eyes: to Scarisbrick the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise. 181 Even among more recent biographers including David Loades David Starkey and John Guy there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the assessment of those he did bring about. 181 This lack of clarity about Henrys control over events has contributed to the variation in the qualities ascribed to him: religious conservative or dangerous radical; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist. 181 One traditional approach favoured by Starkey and others is to divide Henrys reign into two halves the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities politically inclusive pious athletic but also intellectual who presided over a period of stability and calm and the latter a hulking tyrant who presided over a period of dramatic sometimes whimsical change. 180 257 Other writers have tried to merge Henrys disparate personality into a single whole; Lacey Baldwin Smith for example considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions with a mechanical and conventional but deeply held piety and having at best a mediocre intellect. 258 Style and arms Henrys armorial during his early reign left and later reign right Many changes were made to the royal style during his reign. Henry originally used the style Henry the Eighth by the Grace of God King of England France and Lord of Ireland . In 1521 pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his Defence of the Seven Sacraments the royal style became Henry the Eighth by the Grace of God King of England and France Defender of the Faith and Lord of Ireland . Following Henrys excommunication Pope Paul III rescinded the grant of the title Defender of the Faith but an Act of Parliament 35 Hen. 8 . c. 3 declared that it remained valid; and it continues in royal usage to the present day as evidenced by the letters FID DEF or F.D. on all British coinage. Henrys motto was Coeur Loyal true heart and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word loyal . His emblem was the Tudor rose and the Beaufort portcullis . As king Henrys arms were the same as those used by his predecessors since Henry IV : Quarterly Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or for France and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or for England . In 1535 Henry added the supremacy phrase to the royal style which became Henry the Eighth by the Grace of God King of England and France Defender of the Faith Lord of Ireland and of the Church of England in Earth Supreme Head . In 1536 the phrase of the Church of England changed to of the Church of England and also of Ireland . In 1541 Henry had the Irish Parliament change the title Lord of Ireland to King of Ireland with the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 after being advised that many Irish people regarded the Pope as the true head of their country with the Lord acting as a mere representative. The reason the Irish regarded the Pope as their overlord was that Ireland had originally been given to King Henry II of England by Pope Adrian IV in the 12th century as a feudal territory under papal overlordship. The meeting of the Irish Parliament that proclaimed Henry VIII as King of Ireland was the first meeting attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the Anglo-Irish aristocrats. The style Henry the Eighth by the Grace of God King of England France and Ireland Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head remained in use until the end of Henrys reign.

On 11 July 1533 Pope Clement VII pronounced sentence against the King declaring him excommunicated unless he put away the woman he had taken to wife and took back his Queen during the whole of October next. 90 Clement died on 25 September 1534. On 30 August 1535 the new pope Paul III drew up a bull of excommunication which began Eius qui immobilis. 91 92 G. R. Elton puts the date the bull was made official as November 1538. 93 On 17 December 1538 Pope Paul III issued a further bull which began Cum redemptor noster renewing the execution of the bull of 30 August 1535 which had been suspended in hope of his amendment. 94 95 Both bulls are printed by Bishop Burnet History of the Reformation of the Church of England 1865 edition Volume 4 pp. 318ff and in Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurinensis 1857 Volume VI p. 195 Eustace Chapuys wrote to Charles V on 28 January reporting that Anne was pregnant. A letter from George Taylor to Lady Lisle dated 27 April 1534 says The queen hath a goodly belly praying our Lord to send us a prince . In July Annes brother Lord Rochford was sent on a diplomatic mission to France to ask for the postponement of a meeting between Henry VIII and Francis I because of Annes condition: being so far gone with child she could not cross the sea with the king . Chapuys backs this up in a letter dated 27 July where he refers to Annes pregnancy. We do not know what happened with this pregnancy as there is no evidence of the outcome. Dewhurst writes of how the pregnancy could have resulted in a miscarriage or stillbirth but there is no evidence to support this he therefore wonders if it was a case of pseudocyesis a false pregnancy caused by the stress that Anne was under the pressure to provide a son. Chapuys wrote on 27 September 1534 Since the king began to doubt whether his lady was enceinte or not he has renewed and increased the love he formerly had for a beautiful damsel of the court . Muriel St Clair Byrne editor of the Lisle Letters believes that this was a false pregnancy too. The only evidence for a miscarriage in 1535 is a sentence from a letter from William Kingston to Lord Lisle on 24 June 1535 when Kingston says Her Grace has as fair a belly as I have ever seen . However Dewhurst thinks that there is an error in the dating of this letter as the editor of the Lisle Letters states that this letter is actually from 1533 or 1534 because it also refers to Christopher Garneys a man who died in October 1534. Chapuys reported to Charles V on 10 February 1536 that Anne Boleyn had miscarried on the day of Catherine of Aragons funeral: On the day of the interment of Catherine of Aragon the concubine Anne had an abortion which seemed to be a male child which she had not borne 3 12 months .
