Early life and education Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone 5 6 7 was born in the Hells Kitchen neighborhood of New York Citys Manhattan borough 8 on July 6 1946 9 the elder son of womens professional wrestling promoter Jacqueline Jackie Stallone nee Labofish; 19212020 and hairdresser Francesco Frank Stallone Sr. 19192011. 10 His mother was an American from Washington D.C. with Breton French 11 and Ukrainian Jewish ancestry 12 13 14 while his father was an Italian immigrant from Gioia del Colle 10 who moved to the U.S. in the 1930s. 15 16 His younger brother is actor and musician Frank Stallone . 10 Many biographies of Stallone indicate that his birth name is Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone and his mother explained in an interview that she originally named him Tyrone because she admired the actor Tyrone Power but Stallones father changed it to Sylvester . His nickname as a child was Binky but he chose to go by the nickname of MikeMichael after schoolmates began calling him Stinky . 5 6 7 His middle name Gardenzio is an alteration of the Italian given name Gaudenzio and he usually shortened it to Enzio . 1 Complications during Stallones birth forced his mothers obstetricians to use two pairs of forceps while delivering him accidentally severing a nerve in the process. 17 18 This caused paralysis of the lower left side of his face including parts of his lip tongue and chin which gave him his signature snarling look and slurred speech. 18 19 As a result he was bullied in his childhood with which he coped by getting into bodybuilding and acting. 20 A guidance counselor once told Stallones mother: Your son is suited to run a sorting machine or to be an assistant electrician primarily in the area of elevator operations ; nevertheless Sylvester aspired to be an actor and a screenwriter. 21 Stallone spent part of his infancy in foster and boarding care rejoining and moving back with his family to Maryland when he was five. In the early 1950s his father moved the family to his mothers native Washington D.C. to open a beauty school. In 1954 his mother opened a womens gym called Barbellas. 22 23 He initially stayed with his father following his parents divorce when he was 11 but joined his remarried mother in Philadelphia when he was 15. 24 At one point Stallones teachers voted him Most Likely To End Up In The Electric Chair ; 25 nevertheless Stallone attended Notre Dame Academy and Abraham Lincoln High School in Philadelphia 26 and Charlotte Hall Military Academy in Charlotte Hall Maryland prior to attending Miami Dade College . 27 He spent two years from September 1965 to June 1967 at the American College of Switzerland . He returned to the United States to study as a drama major at the University of Miami from 1967 to 1969. 28 After Stallones request that his acting and life experiences be accepted in exchange for his remaining needed college credits to graduate he was granted a Bachelor of Fine Arts BFA degree by the University of Miami in 1998. 29 30 Film and stage career 19681976: early roles to breakthrough Stallone as Rocky Balboa with Adrian Talia Shire in Rocky 1976 Until 1969 he appeared on the stage under the name Mike Stallone; in 1970 he started using the stage name Sylvester E. Stallone. While attending the University of Miami Stallone had a role in the drama That Nice Boy aka The Square Root filmed in 1968. 31 32 33 Moreover he and John Herzfeld worked together in 1969 on a low-budget self-produced film called Horses . 34 Stallone had his first starring role in the softcore pornography feature film The Party at Kitty and Studs 1970. He was paid US200 for two days work. 35 Stallone later explained that he had done the film out of desperation after being evicted from his apartment and finding himself homeless for several days. He has also said that he slept three weeks in the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City prior to seeing a casting notice for the film. In the actors words it was either do that movie or rob someone because I was at the end the very end of my rope . 36 The film was released several years later as Italian Stallion in order to cash in on Stallones newfound fame the new title was taken from Stallones nickname since Rocky . Stallone also starred in the erotic off-Broadway stage play Score which ran for 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 to November 15 1971 and was later made into the 1974 film Score by Radley Metzger . 37 After moving to New York City Stallone shared an apartment with his girlfriend Sasha Czack an aspiring actress who supported them by working as a waitress. 38 Stallone took odd jobs around this time including being a cleaner at a zoo and a theater usher; he was fired from the latter for scalping tickets. He furthered his writing skills by frequenting a local library and became interested in the works of Edgar Allan Poe . 39 In 1972 Stallone was on the verge of giving up on having an acting career; in what he later described as a low point he tried and failed to get a job as an extra in The Godfather . 40 41 Instead he was relegated to a background role in another Hollywood hit Whats Up Doc? starring Barbra Streisand . Stallone is hardly visible in his two appearances. Stallone happened to be acting in a play that a friend invited him to partake in and an agent in attendance thought that Stallone fit the role of Stanley a main character in The Lords of Flatbush which had a start-stop schedule from 1972 to 1974 over budget issues. 42 Stallone around mid-1973 achieved his first proper starring role in the independent film No Place to Hide playing a man who is associated with a New Yorkbased urban terrorist movement with a jewelry-seller as his love interest. The film was re-cut and retitled Rebel years later this second version featuring Stallone as its star. In 1990 this film was re-edited with outtakes from the original film and newly shot matching footage then redubbed in the style of Woody Allen s Whats Up Tiger Lily? into a parody of itself titled A Man Called... Rainbo . Stallones other first few film roles were minor and included brief uncredited appearances in MASH 1970 as a soldier sitting at a table; Pigeons 1970 as a party guest; Woody Allen s Bananas 1971 as a subway thug; in the psychological thriller Klute 1971 as an extra dancing in a club; and in the Jack Lemmon film The Prisoner of Second Avenue 1975 as a youth.

That night Stallone went home and after three days he had completed the first draft of Rocky . 44 Stallone subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for the script; however Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an undisclosed amount. 45 46 Other possible inspirations for the film may have included Rocky Graziano s autobiography Somebody Up There Likes Me and the film of the same name . Stallone attempted to sell the script to multiple studios with the intention of playing the lead role himself. Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff became interested and offered Stallone US350 000 for the rights but they had their own casting ideas for the lead role including Robert Redford and Burt Reynolds . Stallone refused to sell unless he played the lead character and eventually after a substantial budget cut to compromise it was agreed he could be the star. 47 Upon its release critic Roger Ebert stated that Stallone could become the next Marlon Brando . In 1977 at the 49th Academy Awards Rocky was nominated for ten Oscars including Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay nominations for Stallone. The film went on to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture Best Directing and Best Film Editing . Rocky has since been inducted into the National Film Registry and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum .

During the 1980s Stallone was considered one of the biggest action film stars in the world 55 along with Arnold Schwarzenegger . The Schwarzenegger-Stallone rivalry continued for years; 56 they attacked each other in the press and tried to surpass the other with more on-screen killings and larger weapons. 55 Stallone occasionally attempted albeit unsuccessfully roles in different genres.

Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of 13 films.

The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by Variety and horror by top critic Roger Ebert .

It led to the setting up of his production company White Eagle Enterprises. 59 In 1987 he starred in the family drama Over the Top as a struggling trucker who tries to make amends with his estranged son and enters an arm wrestling competition.
