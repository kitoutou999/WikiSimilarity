Jordan Sr. 29 30 He has two older brothers James Jr. and basketball player Larry as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn. 31 32 Jordan and his siblings were raised in the Methodist faith. 33 In 1968 the family moved to Wilmington North Carolina . 34 Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball baseball and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches 1.80 m he was deemed too short. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team. 35 36 Motivated to prove his worth Jordan became the star of Laneys junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games. 35 The following summer he grew four inches 10 cm and trained rigorously. 36 Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game ppg over his final two seasons of high school play. 37 As a senior he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonalds All-American Game and scored 30 points 38 39 after averaging 26.8 ppg 37 11.6 rebounds rpg and 10.1 assists per game apg for the season. 40 Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs including Duke North Carolina South Carolina Syracuse and Virginia . 41 In 1981 he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where Jordan majored in cultural geography . 42 He chose this field of study because of its relationship to meteorology as Jordan was interested in a career as a meteorologist . 43 44 College career Jordan going in for a slam dunk for the Laney High School varsity basketball team c. 197980 Jordan in action for North Carolina in 1983 As a freshman in coach Dean Smith s team-oriented system Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after averaging 13.4 ppg on 53.4 shooting field goal percentage . 45 He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing . 46 Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. 47 48 During his three seasons with the Tar Heels Jordan averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0 shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg. 13 Jordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore 1983 and junior 1984 seasons. 49 50 After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984 Jordan left North Carolina a year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft . Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986 51 when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography. 52 53 In 2002 Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary mens basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history. 54 Professional career Chicago Bulls 19841993; 19951998 Early NBA years 19841987 The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon Houston Rockets and Sam Bowie Portland Trail Blazers . One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center . 55 Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. 56 Citing Bowies injury-laden college career ESPN named the Blazers choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history. 57 Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26 1984 and scored 16 points. In 2021 a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for 264 000 setting a record for a collectible ticket stub. 58 During his rookie 198485 season with the Bulls Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5 shooting 45 and helped make a team that had won 35 of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas. 59 60 61 Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times described Jordan as the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls in November 61 and he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading A Star Is Born in December. 62 63 The fans voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season. 5 Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players led by Isiah Thomas were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving. 5 This led to a so-called freeze-out on Jordan where players refused to pass the ball to him. 5 The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year . 64 The Bulls finished the season 3844 65 and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs . 64 An often-cited moment was on August 26 1985 37 66 when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste Italy by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk. 67 68 The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordans rise. 68 69 The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for 615 000 a record for a pair of sneakers. 70 71 Jordans 198586 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year causing him to miss 64 games. 72 The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordans injury and a 3052 record 65 at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history. 73 Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden in Game 2 of the First Round a 135131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points breaking Elgin Baylor s single-game playoff scoring record . 74 A Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history swept the series in three games. 64 74 75 Jordan completely recovered in time for the 198687 season 76 and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3 000 points in a season averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2 shooting. 45 77 Jordan also demonstrated his defensive prowess as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season. 78 Despite Jordans success Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award . 79 The Bulls reached 40 wins 65 and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics . 64 Pistons roadblock 19871990 Jordan led the league in scoring during the 198788 season averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5 shooting 45 and won his first league MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 1.6 blocks per game bpg a league-high 3.1 steals per game spg 80 c and leading the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league. 82 The Bulls finished 5032 65 and made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordans career as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. 83 In the Eastern Conference Semifinals the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons 64 who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the Bad Boys . 84 In the 198889 season Jordan again led the league in scoring averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8 shooting from the field along with 8.0 rpg and 8.0 apg. 45 During the season Sam Vincent Chicagos point guard was having trouble running the offense and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games with averages of 33.6 ppg 11.4 rpg 10.8 apg 2.9 spg and 0.8 bpg on 51 shooting. 85 The Bulls finished with a 4735 record 65 and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way. 86 The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit The Shot over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series. 87 In the Eastern Conference Finals the Pistons again defeated the Bulls this time in six games 64 by utilizing their Jordan Rules method of guarding Jordan which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball. 5 The Bulls entered the 198990 season as a team on the rise with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson . 88 On March 28 1990 Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117113 road win over the Cavaliers. 89 He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6 shooting to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg 45 in leading the Bulls to a 5527 record. 65 They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers ; 90 despite pushing the series to seven games the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season. 64 First three-peat 19911993 Jordan being defended by Mookie Blaylock number 10 during a BullsNets game in 1991 In the 199091 season Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9 shooting 6.0 rpg and 5.5 apg for the regular season. 45 The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season. 65 With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs . They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival the Detroit Pistons awaited them; 91 this time the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep. 92 The Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series in five games and compiled a 152 playoff record along the way. 91 Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when attempting a dunk Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. 93 In his first Finals appearance Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56 shooting from the field 11.4 apg 6.6 rpg 2.8 spg and 1.4 bpg. 94 Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award 95 and cried while holding the Finals trophy. 96 Jordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 199192 season establishing a 6715 record topping their franchise record from the 199091 campaign. 65 Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg 6.4 rpg and 6.1 apg on 52 shooting. 80 After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals . The media hoping to recreate a MagicBird rivalry highlighted the similarities between Air Jordan and Clyde The Glide during the pre-Finals hype. 97 In a Game 1 victory Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half including a record-setting six three-point field goals . 98 After the sixth three-pointer he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert who broadcast the game later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: I cant believe Im doing this. 99 The Bulls went on to defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row 95 and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg 4.8 rpg and 6.5 apg while shooting 52.6 from the floor. 100 In the 199293 season despite a 32.6 ppg 6.7 rpg and 5.5 apg campaign including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting 80 101 Jordans streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley 79 upsetting him. 102 Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals . The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant but Jordan was once again Chicagos leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series 103 and became the first player in NBA history to win three consecutive Finals MVP awards. 95 Jordan scored more than 30 points in every game of the series including 40 or more points in four consecutive games. 104 With his third Finals triumph Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life. 105 Gambling During the 1993 NBA playoffs Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City New Jersey the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks . 106 The previous year he admitted that he had to cover 57 000 in gambling losses 107 and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won 1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course. 108 David Stern the commissioner of the NBA denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordans 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling 109 110 but the rumor spread widely. 111 In 2005 Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: Yeah Ive gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and Ive pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah it depends on how you look at it. If youre willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family then yeah. When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family Jordan replied: No. 112 In 2010 Ron Shelton director of Jordan Rides the Bus said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him but that research convinced him it was nonsense . 111 First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball 19931995 Baseball player Michael Jordan Jordan in training with the Scottsdale Scorpions in 1994 Birmingham Barons No. 45 35 Outfielder Batted: Right Threw: Right Professional debut Southern League : April 8 1994 for the Birmingham Barons Arizona Fall League : 1994 for the Scottsdale Scorpions Last Southern League appearance March 10 1995 for the Birmingham Barons Southern League statistics through 1994 Batting average .202 Home runs 3 Runs batted in 51 Arizona Fall League statistics Batting average .252 Runs batted in 8 Teams Birmingham Barons 19941995 Scottsdale Scorpions 1994 On October 6 1993 Jordan announced his retirement saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. Jordan later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision. 113 James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23 1993 at a highway rest area in Lumberton North Carolina by two teenagers Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery who carjacked his Lexus . 114 115 His body dumped in a South Carolina swamp was not discovered until August 3. 115 Green and Demery were sentenced to life imprisonment. 116 Jordan was close to his father; as a child Jordan imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. Jordan later adopted it as his own signature often displaying it as he drove to the basket. 5 In 1996 Jordan founded a Chicago-area Boys Girls Club and dedicated it to his father. 117 118 In his 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992. 119 The added exhaustion due to the Dream Team run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordans feelings about the game and his celebrity status. Jordans announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world. 120 Jordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball MiLB contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7 1994. 121 He reported to spring training in Sarasota Florida and was assigned to the teams minor league system on March 31. 122 Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball MLB player. 123 The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf who continued to honor Jordans basketball contract during the years he played baseball. 124 In 1994 Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox batting .202 with three home runs 51 runs batted in 30 stolen bases 114 strikeouts 51 bases on balls and 11 errors . 125 126 His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady . 127 Jordan also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball. 122 On November 1 1994 his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as The Spirit outside the new United Center . 128 129 130 Return to the NBA 1995 The Bulls went 5527 in 199394 without Jordan in the lineup 65 and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs . 131 The 199495 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs Chicago was 3131 at one point in mid-March; 132 the team received help when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls. 133 In March 1995 Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike . 134 On March 18 1995 Jordan announced his return to the NBA in a two-word press release: Im back. 135 The next day Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis scoring 19 points. 136 The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975. 137 Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it Jordan wore No. 45 his baseball number. 136 Despite his 18-month hiatus from the NBA Jordan played well making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28 1995. 64 Boosted by Jordans comeback the Bulls went 134 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic . 138 At the end of Game 1 Orlandos Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan didnt look like the old Michael Jordan 139 and said No. 45 doesnt explode like No. 23 used to . 140 Jordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game which Chicago won. Before the game Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined 25 000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA. 140 Jordan was fined an additional 5 000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black. 141 He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs but Orlando won the series in six games. 142 Second three-peat 19961998 Jordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat and he trained aggressively for the 199596 season . 143 The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman and the team dominated the league starting the season at 413. 144 The Bulls finished with the best regular season record in NBA history 7210 a mark broken two decades later by the 201516 Golden State Warriors . 145 Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg 146 and he won the leagues regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards. 13 In the playoffs the Bulls lost only three games in four series Miami Heat 30 New York Knicks 41 and Orlando Magic 40 as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 42 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. 144 Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time; 95 he achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game regular season and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 196970 season . 64 Upon winning the championship his first since his fathers murder Jordan reacted emotionally clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor. 5 96 In the 199697 season the Bulls stood at a 6911 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 6913 missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season. 147 The Bulls again advanced to the Finals where they faced the Utah Jazz . 148 That team included Karl Malone who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race 986957. 149 150 151 The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordans career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5 with the series tied 22 Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as The Flu Game Jordan scored 38 points including the game-winning three-pointer with 25 seconds remaining. 148 The Bulls won 9088 and went on to win the series in six games. 147 For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances Jordan received the Finals MVP award. 95 During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game he posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort but the MVP award went to Glen Rice . 152 Jordan with coach Phil Jackson in 1997 The Bulls compiled a 6220 record in the 199798 season . 65 Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg 80 securing his fifth regular season MVP award plus honors for All-NBA First Team First Defensive Team and the All-Star Game MVP. 13 The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks . 153 154 After winning they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals . 155 The Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14 1998 leading the series 32. Jordan executed a series of plays considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. 156 With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 8683 Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed Jordan received the inbound pass drove to the basket and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders cutting Utahs lead to 8685. 156 The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands. 156 Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused eyeing his defender Jazz guard Bryon Russell . With 10 seconds remaining Jordan started to dribble right then crossed over to his left possibly pushing off Russell although the officials did not call a foul . 157 158 159 160 With 5.2 seconds left Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career 161 a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 8786 lead. Afterwards the Jazz John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship 162 achieving a second three-peat in the decade. 163 Once again Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time 95 having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg including 45 in the deciding Game 6. 164 The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series 165 and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history. 166 Second retirement 19992001 Plaque at the United Center that chronicles Jordans career achievements With Phil Jackson s contract expiring the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players Jordan retired for the second time on January 13 1999. 167 168 169 On January 19 2000 Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards . 170 Jordans responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards basketball operations and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. 171 172 He managed to purge the team of several highly paid unpopular players like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland 173 174 but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons. 171 175 Despite his January 1999 claim that he was 99.9 certain he would never play another NBA game 96 Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001 this time with his new team. 176 177 Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter 178 Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago. 179 Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach Doug Collins as Washingtons coach for the upcoming season a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return. 176 177 Washington Wizards 20012003 On September 25 2001 Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks . 180 181 In an injury-plagued 200102 season Jordan led the team in scoring 22.9 ppg assists 5.2 apg and steals 1.4 spg 5 and was an MVP candidate as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention; 182 183 Jordan would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot. 184 After he suffered torn cartilage in his right knee 185 and subsequent knee soreness 186 the Wizards missed the playoffs 187 and Jordans season ended after only 60 games the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 199495 season . 45 Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season averaging 24.3 ppg 5.4 apg and 6.0 rpg and shooting 41.9 from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game. 188 The Wizards finished the season with a 3745 record an 18-game improvement. 187 Jordan in 2003 Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003 Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James . 189 190 That year Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games starting in 67 of them as he came off the bench in 15. Jordan averaged 20.0 ppg 6.1 rpg 3.8 assists and 1.5 spg per game. 5 He also shot 45 from the field and 82 from the free-throw line. 45 Although Jordan turned 40 during the season he scored 20 or more points 42 times 30 or more points nine times and 40 or more points three times. 64 On February 21 2003 Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. 191 During his stint with the Wizards all of Jordans home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA averaging 20 172 fans a game at home and 19 311 on the road. 192 Jordans final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. 193 194 At several points Jordan openly criticized his teammates to the media citing their lack of focus and intensity notably that of Kwame Brown the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft . 193 194 Final retirement 2003 With the recognition that 200203 would be Jordans final season tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago which was his old home court Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation. 195 The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11 2003 even though Jordan never played for the team. 196 At the 2003 All-Star Game Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both; 197 he accepted the spot of Vince Carter . 198 Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16 2003 in Philadelphia . After scoring 13 points in the game Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds left in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 7556. Just after the start of the fourth quarter the First Union Center crowd began chanting We want Mike! After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45 Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers Eric Snow and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. He received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates his opponents the officials and the crowd of 21 257 fans. 199 National team career Jordan on the U.S. Olympic team in 1992 Jordan made his debut as a college player for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S. coached by Jack Hartman won the gold medal . 200 201 The following year Jordan won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics . The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured young players such as Patrick Ewing Sam Perkins Chris Mullin Steve Alford and Wayman Tisdale . Jordan led the team in scoring averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament. 202 In 1992 Jordan now an NBA player was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the Dream Team which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team won two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas 203 and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics . Jordan was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics averaged 14.9 ppg and finished second on the team in scoring. 204 He was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team and Jordan won all 30 games he took part in. 15 Player profile Jordan dunking the ball 198788 Jordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards 13 and as a point guard . 85 Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests. 205 His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic. 206 207 208 Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as a killer in the Darwinian sense of the word immediately sensing and attacking someones weakest spot . 3 As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan management had to trade away players who were not tough enough to compete with him in practice. To improve his defense Jordan spent hours studying film of opponents. On offense he relied more upon instinct and improvization. 209 Noted as a durable player Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 198687 to 200102 when he injured his right knee. 13 210 Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA he played all 82 regular season games nine times. 13 Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson Walter Davis and Jerry West as influences. 211 212 Confirmed at the start of his career and possibly later on Jordan had a special Love of the Game Clause written into his contract which was unusual at the time and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time anywhere. 213 Jordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8 772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history. 214 Early in Jordans career he weighed in at around 200 pounds 91 kg and was more athletic in terms of play style. 215 As his career progressed Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown this move alone made Jordan nearly unstoppable. 216 Around this time he bulked up to 215 pounds 98 kg in order to adapt to the increased physicality of NBA defenses during the 1990s sacrificing some athleticism for added strength in the post. 215 Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg. 45 For a guard Jordan was also a good rebounder finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg. 45 The three-point field goal was not Jordans strength especially in his early years. Later on in his career Jordan improved his three-point shooting and finished his career with a respectable 32 success rate. 45 His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35 to 43 in seasons where Jordan attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 198990 and 199697. 13 His effective field goal percentage was 50 and he had six seasons with at least 50 shooting five of which consecutively 19881992; Jordan also shot 51 and 50 and 30 and 33 from the three-point range throughout his first and second retirements respectively finishing his Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG shooting. 13 Unlike NBA players often compared to Jordan such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James who had a similar three-point percentage he did not shoot as many threes as they did as Jordan did not need to rely on the three-pointer to be effective on offense. Three-point shooting was only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamental aspect of the game until the first decades of the 21st century 217 with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots. 218 Jordans three-point shooting was better selected resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during the playoffs and the Finals such as hitting six consecutive three-point shots in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals . Jordan shot 37 35 42 and 37 in all the seasons he shot over 200 three-pointers and also shot 38.5 38.6 38.9 40.3 19.4 and 30.2 in the playoffs during his championship runs improving his shooting even after the three-point line reverted to the original line. 219 220 221 In 1988 Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. He also set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard 222 and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. Jordan ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2 514 trailing John Stockton Jason Kidd and Chris Paul . 223 Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordans defensive contributions than his offensive ones. 224 Doc Rivers declared Jordan the best superstar defender in the history of the game . 225 Jordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that Jordan was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch 69 cm television clearly from about 50 feet 15 m away. 226 During the 2001 NBA Finals Phil Jackson compared Jordans dominance to Shaquille ONeal stating: Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion. 227 Legacy This article is part of a series about Michael Jordan Career Career achievements The Shot Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals 1982 NCAA Championship Game Air Jordan Jumpman Jordan Rules Family James R.

In the regular season Jordan was the Bulls primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time. 231 Jordans total of 5 987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders . 232 He scored 32 292 points in the regular season 233 placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Karl Malone and Bryant. 233 With five regular season MVPs tied for second place with Bill Russell only Abdul-Jabbar has won more with six six Finals MVPs NBA record and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history. 13 234 He finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times. 13 Jordan was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 235 and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. 23 He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship an NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. mens basketball teams. 236 Since 1976 the year of the ABANBA merger 237 Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team. 238 In the All-Star Game fan ballot Jordan received the most votes nine times more than any other player. 239 Theres Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us. Magic Johnson 5 Many of Jordans contemporaries have said that he is the greatest basketball player of all time. 224 In 1999 an ESPN survey of journalists athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century. 240 Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press December 1999 list of 20th century athletes. 241 The Associated Press also voted Jordan the greatest basketball player of the 20th century. 242 He has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times. 243 In the September 1996 issue of Sport which was the publications 50th-anniversary issue Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years. 244 Jordans athletic leaping ability highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988 is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players. 245 246 Several NBA players including James and Dwyane Wade have stated that they considered Jordan as their role model while they were growing up. 247 248 Commentators have also dubbed a number of next-generation players the next Michael Jordan upon their entry to the NBA including Penny Hardaway Grant Hill Allen Iverson Bryant Vince Carter James and Wade. 249 250 251 Some analysts such as The Ringer s Dan Devine drew parallels between Jordans experiment at point guard in the 198889 season and the modern NBA; for Devine it inadvertently foreshadowed the modern games stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers such as Russell Westbrook James Harden Luka Doncic and James. 252 Don Nelson stated: I wouldve been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie. 253 Although Jordan was a well-rounded player his Air Jordan image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills defense and fundamentals of young players 245 a fact Jordan himself has lamented saying: I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game but it was never really publicized. 245 During his heyday Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league. 254 The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title. 254 As late as 2022 NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season. 255 In August 2009 the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield Massachusetts opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 Dream Team ; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordans short career in the Minor League Baseball . 256 After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him. 257 As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009 he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack . In September Jordan was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance including Scottie Pippen Dennis Rodman Charles Oakley Ron Harper Steve Kerr and Toni Kukoc . 17 Dean Smith and Doug Collins two of Jordans former coaches were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when Jordan began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the Crying Jordan Internet meme. 258 259 In 2016 President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom . 27 In October 2021 he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team . 23 In September 2022 Jordans jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for 10.1 million making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history. 260 In December 2022 the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy named in Jordans honor to be awarded beginning with the 202223 season which replaced the original trophy named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff . 261 262 NBA

He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles. 284 Since 2004 Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association AMA until the end of the 2013 season. 285 286 Charlotte BobcatsHornets On June 15 2006 Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats known as the Hornets since 2013 becoming the teams second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson . As part of the deal Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations. 287 288 Despite his previous success as an endorser Jordan made an effort not to be included in Charlottes marketing campaigns. 289 A decade earlier he had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlottes original NBA team the Charlotte Hornets but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations. 290 In February 2010 it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats. 291 As February wore on it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27 the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group MJ Basketball Holdings to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval. 292 On March 17 the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordans purchase making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team 293 and the leagues only African-American majority owner. 294 During the 2011 NBA lockout The New York Times wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that during the labor dispute in 1998 Jordan told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin : If you cant make a profit you should sell your team. 295 Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon for wanting current players to pay for his incompetence . 296 He cited Jordans executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison . 296 During the 201112 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout the Bobcats posted a 759 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history. 297 Before the next season Jordan said: Im not real happy about the record book scenario last year. Its very very frustrating. 298 During the 2019 NBA offseason Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim retaining the majority for himself 299 as well as the role of chairman. 300 In 2023 Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner although he kept a minority stake. 301 The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately 3 billion more than 10 times the 275 million Jordan had paid for the team. 302 23XI Racing On September 21 2020 Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving beginning competition in the 2021 season . 303 On October 22 the teams name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing pronounced twenty-three eleven and the teams entry would bear No. 23. 304 After the teams inaugural season it added a second car with No. 45 driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023 . 305 306 Ty Gibbs John Hunter Nemechek and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season. 307 308 309 The team fielded a third car No. 67 driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500 . 310 23XI Racing has won seven races two by Wallace four by Reddick and one by Busch. 311 312 313 314 315 Reddick won the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series regular season championship the first for the team. 315 Personal life Jordan left receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama at the White House Jordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2 1989. 316 317 They had three children: Jeffrey Marcus and Jasmine. 318 The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4 2002 citing irreconcilable differences but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29 2006 commenting that the decision was made mutually and amicably . 319 320 It is reported that Juanita received a 168 million settlement equivalent to 254 million in 2023 making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time. 321 322 In 1991 Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park Illinois where he planned to build a 56 000-square-foot 5 200 m 2 mansion. It was completed in 1995. Jordan listed the mansion for sale in 2012. 323 He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island Florida . 324 On July 21 2006 a judge in Cook County Illinois determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel 5 million in a breach of contract claim. 325 Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel 250 000 to keep their relationship a secret. 326 327 328 Knafel claimed Jordan promised her 5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed that Jordan was not the father of the child. 325 Jordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto on Christmas 2011 329 and they were married on April 27 2013 at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. 330 331 It was announced on November 30 2013 that the two were expecting their first child together. 332 333 On February 11 2014 Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel. 334 In 2019 Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas . 335 Media figure and business interests Endorsements Jordan right in 2008 Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike Coca-Cola Chevrolet Gatorade McDonalds Ball Park Franks Rayovac Wheaties Hanes and MCI . 336 Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991 including the Be Like Mike commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan. 336 337 Nike created a signature shoe for Jordan called the Air Jordan in 1984. 338 One of his more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon . In the commercials Lee as Blackmon attempted to find the source of Jordans abilities and became convinced that its gotta be the shoes . 336 The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of shoe-jackings in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the Jordan Brand . The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers. 339 340 The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina UCLA California Oklahoma Florida Georgetown and Marquette . 341 342 Jordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992s Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball. 343 The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live actionanimated film Space Jam which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the formers first retirement from basketball. 344 They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI. 344 Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson s Jam 1992. 345 Since 2008 Jordans yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over 40 million. 346 347 In addition when his power at the ticket gates was at its highest point the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games. 348 Due to this Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US30 million per season. 349 An academic study found that his first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than 1 billion. 350 Most of Jordans endorsement deals including his first deal with Nike were engineered by his agent David Falk . 351 Jordan has described Falk as the best at what he does and that marketing-wise hes great. Hes the one who came up with the concept of Air Jordan. 352 Business ventures In June 2010 Jordan was ranked by Forbes as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world with 55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to Forbes Jordan Brand generates 1 billion in sales for Nike. 353 In June 2014 Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80 to 89.5. 354 355 On January 20 2015 Jordan was honored with the Charlotte Business Journal s Business Person of the Year for 2014. 356 In 2017 he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball . 357 Forbes designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017. 358 From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements Jordans 2015 income was an estimated 110 million the most of any retired athlete. 359 As of 2024 update his net worth is estimated at 3.2 billion by Forbes 28 making him the fifth-richest African-American behind Robert F. Smith David Steward Oprah Winfrey and Rihanna . 360 Jordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham North Carolina acquired in 1990 361 and formerly had a Lincoln Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009. 362 363 The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie Maryland . 362 The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordans. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York Citys Grand Central Terminal among others; 364 that restaurant closed in 2018. 365 Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course Grove XXIII in Hobe Sound Florida . 366 In September 2020 Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings . 367 Philanthropy From 2001 to 2014 Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational that raised money for various charities. 368 In 2006 Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged 5 million to Chicagos Hales Franciscan High School . 369 The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys Girls Clubs of America . 370 The Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008. 368 In 2013 he granted his 200th wish for the organization. 371 As of 2019 Jordan has raised more than 5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 368 In 2023 he donated 10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday. 372 In 2015 Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities. 373 In 2017 Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte North Carolina by giving 7 million the biggest donation he had made at the time. 374 The following year after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina including his former hometown of Wilmington Jordan donated 2 million to relief efforts. 375 He gave 1 million to aid the Bahamas recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019. 376 On June 5 2020 in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating 100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to ensuring racial equality social justice and greater access to education . 377 In February 2021 Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County North Carolina by giving 10 million. 378 379 In 2024 he funded the opening of another Novant Health Clinic this time in Wilmington. 380 Film and television Jordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film Space Jam . The film received mixed reviews 381 but it was a box office success making 230 million worldwide and earned more than 1 billion through merchandise sales. 382 In 2000 Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls especially the 1998 NBA playoffs titled Michael Jordan to the Max . 383 Two decades later the same period of Jordans life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award -winning The Last Dance a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. The Last Dance relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordans and his teammates off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 199798 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used. 384 385 Jordan was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane as according to director Jason Hehir there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private . 386 Jordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single Franchise at his home in Highland Park Illinois . 387 Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries The Captain which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter . 388 Books Jordan has authored several books focusing on his life basketball career and world view.

Jordans return from three years of retirement has been remarkable with five 40-point performances already. He is also rebounding and handing out assists on par with his career averages.
