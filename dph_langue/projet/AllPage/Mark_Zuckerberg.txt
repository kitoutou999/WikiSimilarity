IPO v t e Mark Elliot Zuckerberg z k r b r ; born May 14 1984 is an American businessman. He co-founded the social media service Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms formerly Facebook Inc. of which he is chairman chief executive officer and controlling shareholder. Zuckerberg has been the subject of multiple lawsuits regarding the creation and ownership of the website as well as issues such as user privacy. Zuckerberg briefly attended Harvard College where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates Eduardo Saverin Andrew McCollum Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes . Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. He became the worlds youngest self-made billionaire in 2008 at age 23 and has consistently ranked among the worlds wealthiest individuals . He has also used his funds to organize multiple donations including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative . A film depicting Zuckerbergs early career legal troubles and initial success with Facebook The Social Network was released in 2010 and won multiple Academy Awards . His prominence and fast rise in the technology industry has prompted political and legal attention. Early life and education Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14 1984 in White Plains New York to psychiatrist Karen nee Kempner and dentist Edward Zuckerberg. 1 2 He and his three sisters Arielle Randi and Donna were raised in a Reform Jewish household 3 in Dobbs Ferry New York . 4 His great-grandparents were emigrants from Austria Germany and Poland. 5 Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy . He was captain of the fencing team. 6 7 Software development Early years Zuckerberg had learnt computer programming while young. At about the age of eleven he created ZuckNet a program that allowed computers at the family home and his fathers dental office to communicate with each other. 8 During Zuckerbergs high-school years he worked to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the users listening habits which was posted to Slashdot 9 and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine . 10 The New Yorker once said of Zuckerberg: some kids played computer games. Mark created them . 4 While still in high school he attended Mercy College taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings. 4 College years The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002 he had already achieved a reputation as a programming prodigy . 4 He studied psychology and computer science 11 resided in Kirkland House 12 and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi . 4 In his second year he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups. 13 Later he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit Zuckerbergs roommate at the time explained: We had books called Face Books which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was hotter and according to the votes there would be a ranking. 14 The site went up over a weekend but by Monday morning the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvards network switches preventing students from accessing the Internet. 15 In addition many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was completely improper . 14 Career Facebook Further information: Facebook and History of Facebook External videos Mark Zuckerbergs career in 90 seconds Tech Gurus via The Daily Telegraph 16 In January 2004 Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website. 17 On February 4 2004 Zuckerberg launched Thefacebook originally located at thefacebook.com in partnership with his roommates Eduardo Saverin Andrew McCollum Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes . 18 19 An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory The Photo Address Book which students referred to as The Facebook . Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them students were able to list attributes such as their class years their friends and their telephone numbers. 19 Zuckerberg in 2005 Six days after the site launched three Harvard seniors Cameron Winklevoss Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com when he was using their ideas to build a competing product. 20 The three complained to The Harvard Crimson and the newspaper began an investigation in response. While Zuckerberg tried to convince the editors not to run the story 21 he also broke into two of the editors email accountsfor which he made use of their private login data logs from TheFacebook. 22 23 Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement. 24 The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares and 20 million in cash. 25 Zuckerbergs Facebook started off as just a Harvard thing until he decided to spread it to other schools enlisting the help of roommate and co-founder Dustin Moskovitz . 26 They began with Columbia University New York University Stanford University Dartmouth College Cornell University University of Pennsylvania Brown University and Yale University . 27 Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete the project. 28 Zuckerberg Moskovitz and the other co-founders moved to Palo Alto California where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel who invested in his company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg the group planned to return to Harvard but eventually decided to remain in California where Zuckerberg appreciated the mythical place of Silicon Valley the center of computer technology in California. 29 30 They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007 Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: Its not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me . 31 The same year speaking at Y Combinator s Startup School course at Stanford University Zuckerberg made a controversial assertion that young people are just smarter and that other entrepreneurs should bias towards hiring young people. 32 He restated these goals to Wired magazine in 2010: The thing I really care about is the mission making the world open . 33 Earlier in April 2009 Zuckerberg had sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie regarding financing strategies for Facebook. 34 On July 21 2010 Zuckerberg reported that Facebook had reached the 500-million-user mark. 35 When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth he explained: I guess we could ... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads ... Thats the simplest thing we could do. But we arent like that. We make enough money. Right I mean we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to. 33 In 2010 Steven Levy who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution wrote that Zuckerberg clearly thinks of himself as a hacker . Zuckerberg said that its OK to break things to make them better . 36 37 Facebook instituted hackathons held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project. 36 The company provided music food and beer at the hackathons and many Facebook staff members including Zuckerberg regularly attended. 37 The idea is that you can build something really good in a night Zuckerberg told Levy. And thats part of the personality of Facebook now ... Its definitely very core to my personality . 36 In 2007 Zuckerberg was added to MIT Technology Review s TR35 list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35. 38 Vanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 most influential people of the Information Age . 39 Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009. 40 In 2010 Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesman s annual survey of the worlds 50 most influential figures. 41 In a 2011 interview with PBS shortly after the death of Steve Jobs Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was focused on building as high quality and good things as you are . 42 Zuckerberg and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev during their meeting at the Russian leaders residence outside Moscow October 1 2012 On October 1 2012 Zuckerberg met with then Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebooks position in the Russian market. 43 44 Russias communications minister tweeted that Medvedev persuaded Zuckerberg to open a research center in Moscow instead of trying to lure away Russian programmers. In 2012 Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia while domestic clone VK had around 34 million. 45 46 Rebecca Van Dyck Facebooks head of consumer marketing said that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6 2013. 47 On August 19 2013 The Washington Post reported that Zuckerbergs Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer. 48 At the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference held in September Zuckerberg stated that he was working towards registering the 5 billion people who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project whereby Facebook with the support of other technology companies seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet. 49 50 Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress MWC held in Barcelona Spain in March 2014 which was attended by 75 000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebooks focus on mobile technology and Zuckerbergs speech stating that mobile represents the future of the company. 51 Zuckerbergs speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013 whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries. 52 Alongside other American technology figures like Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei known as the Internet czar for his influence in the enforcement of Chinas online policy at Facebooks headquarters on December 8 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a QA session at Tsinghua University in Beijing China on October 23 2014 where he conversed in Mandarin Chinese ; although Facebook is banned in China Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nations burgeoning entrepreneur sector. 53 Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live QA session at the companys headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time because it facilitates social engagement and participating in a public session was so that he could learn how to better serve the community . 54 55 Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook. 56 In June 2016 Business Insider named Zuckerberg one of the Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World along with Elon Musk and Sal Khan due to the fact that he and his wife pledged to give away 99 of their wealth-then estimated at 55.0 billion . 57 On May 25 2017 at Harvards 366th commencement day Zuckerberg after giving a commencement speech 58 received an honorary degree from Harvard. 59 60 In January 2019 Zuckerberg laid plans to integrate an end-to-end encrypted system for three major social media platforms including Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp . 61 On August 14 2020 Facebook integrated the chat systems for Instagram and Messenger on both iOS and Android devices. The update encouraged cross-communication between Instagram and Facebook users. 62 Other projects Zuckerberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland January 2009 A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004 i2hub another campus-only service created by Wayne Chang and focusing on peer-to-peer file sharing was launched. At the time both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004 Zuckerberg Andrew McCollum Adam DAngelo and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog a precursor to Facebook Platform applications which was launched in 2007. 63 64 65 In 2013 Zuckerberg launched Internet.org which he described as an initiative to provide Internet access to the five billion people without it as of the launch date. The project faced significant opposition in India where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the principle of net neutrality ; Zuckerberg responded by saying that a limited internet was better than no internet. Internet.org was shut down in India in February 2016 although Zuckerberg later met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss further possibilities. 66 67 Zuckerberg is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot which he co-founded with Yuri Milner and Stephen Hawking in 2016. 68 Legal trouble See also: Criticism of Facebook ConnectU lawsuits Main article: ConnectU Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com later called ConnectU . 20 They filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in a federal court in Boston . Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub . On June 25 2008 the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay 20 million in cash. 69 In November 2007 confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138 a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerbergs Social Security number his parents home address and his girlfriends address. Though Facebook filed to have the documents removed the judge ruled in favor of 02138 . 70 Eduardo Saverin Main article: Eduardo Saverin In 2005 Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg and Facebook alleging that Zuckerberg had illegally spent Saverins money on personal expenses. The lawsuit was settled out of court and though terms of the settlement were sealed the company affirmed Saverins title as co-founder of Facebook and Saverin agreed to stop talking to the press. 71 72 Pakistan criminal investigation In June 2010 then Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a Draw Muhammad contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation also named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the countrys police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy . On May 19 2010 Facebooks website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly . 73 74 Paul Ceglia Main article: Paul Ceglia In June 2010 Paul Ceglia the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County upstate New York filed suit against Zuckerberg claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28 2003 that an initial fee of 1 000 entitled Ceglia to 50 of the websites revenue as well as an additional 1 interest in the business per day after January 1 2004 until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time among which was Facemash the predecessor to Facebook but did not register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 1 2004. The Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as completely frivolous . Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglias counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement. 75 76 On October 26 2012 federal authorities arrested Ceglia charging him with mail and wire fraud and of tampering with destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars . Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook although after examining their emails investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them. 77 Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglias arrest. 78 79 Hawaiian land ownership In 2014 Zuckerberg purchased 700 acres of land on the Hawaiian island of Kauai . In January 2017 Zuckerberg filed eight quiet title and partition lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to claim small tracts of land that they owned within his acreage. 80 Zuckerberg responded to criticisms in a Facebook post stating that the lawsuits were a good faith effort to pay the partial owners of the land their fair share . 80 When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states he dropped the lawsuits. Zuckerberg stated that he regretted not taking the time to understand the process and its history before moving ahead. 81 82 Testimony before U.S. Congress On April 10 and 11 2018 Zuckerberg testified before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation regarding the usage of personal data by Facebook in relation to the FacebookCambridge Analytica data scandal . 83 84 He called the whole affair a breach of trust between Aleksandr Kogan Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. 85 Zuckerberg refused requests to appear to give evidence on the matter to a Parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom. 86 On October 1 2020 the US Senate Commerce Committee unanimously voted to issue subpoenas to the CEOs of three top tech firms including Zuckerberg Google s Sundar Pichai and Twitter s Jack Dorsey . The subpoenas aimed to force the CEOs to testify about the legal immunity the law affords tech platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934. US Republicans argued that the law unduly protected social media companies against allegations of anti-conservative censorship. 87 On March 25 2021 Zuckerberg testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee regarding Facebooks role in the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the platform. During the hearing he was questioned about Facebooks handling of user data its role in the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol Building and its efforts to combat misinformation and hate speech. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook had a responsibility to address these issues and outlined the steps that the company is taking to improve its policies and practices. The hearing was part of a broader effort by Congress to hold tech companies accountable for their role in shaping public discourse and protecting user privacy. 88 In a January 2024 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and social media platforms Zuckerberg along with other tech CEOs were questioned about their companies practices. During the hearing he apologized to the families of children who were victims of online abuse and harm. 89 90 Metas proposal Court documents allege that Zuckerberg personally rejected Metas proposals to improve teenagers mental health. He consistently opposed efforts to enhance well-being on Facebook and Instagram overriding senior executives like Instagram head Adam Mosseri and Global Affairs President Nick Clegg as revealed in an ongoing lawsuit. Internal communications disclosed in the Massachusetts-initiated legal action depict Zuckerbergs resistance to better protect over 30 million teens on Instagram in the U.S. highlighting his substantial influence on Metas decisions impacting billions of users. These documents also shed light on occasional tensions between Zuckerberg and other Meta officials advocating for improved user well-being. 91 Depictions in media The Social Network Further information: The Social Network Jesse Eisenberg pictured played Zuckerberg in The Social Network . A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook The Social Network was released on October 1 2010 starring Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film he responded I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive . 92 Also after the films script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a good guy . 93 The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich which the books publicist once described as big juicy fun rather than reportage . 94 The films screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine I dont want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling adding What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracys sake and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good? 95 Upon winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture on January 16 2011 producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other . 96 Sorkin who won for Best Screenplay retracted some of the impressions given in his script: 97 I wanted to say to Mark Zuckerberg tonight if youre watching Rooney Mara s character makes a prediction at the beginning of the movie. She was wrong. You turned out to be a great entrepreneur a visionary and an incredible altruist. In January 2011 Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live which was hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they had met. 98 Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg who had been critical of his portrayal by the film what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied It was interesting . 99 In a subsequent interview about their meeting Eisenberg explained that he was nervous to meet him because I had spent now a year and a half thinking about him ... He added Mark has been so gracious about something thats really so uncomfortable ... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. Its the best possible way to handle something that I think could otherwise be very uncomfortable . 100 101 Disputed accuracy According to David Kirkpatrick former technology editor at Fortune magazine and author of The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that is Connecting the World 2011 102 the film is only 40 true ... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie . He says that a lot of the factual incidents are accurate but many are distorted and the overall impression is false and concludes that primarily his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet . 103 Although the film portrayed Zuckerbergs creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard Zuckerberg stated that he had no interest in joining the clubs. 4 Kirkpatrick agreed that the impression implied by the film is false . Karel Baloun a former senior engineer at Facebook noted that the image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated ... It is fiction ... He likewise dismissed the films assertion that he would deliberately betray a friend . 103 Other depictions Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of The Simpsons titled Loan-a Lisa which first aired on October 3 2010. In the episode Lisa Simpson and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful referencing Bill Gates and Richard Branson as examples. 104 On October 9 2010 Saturday Night Live lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook. 105 Andy Samberg portrayed the role of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg himself was reported to have been amused: I thought this was funny . 106 Stephen Colbert awarded a Medal of Fear to Zuckerberg at the Rally to Restore Sanity andor Fear on October 30 2010 because he values his privacy much more than he values yours . 107 Zuckerberg appeared in the climax of 2013 documentary film Terms and Conditions May Apply . 108 109 110 The South Park episode Franchise Prequel mocked him. According to CNET he was portrayed as a rosy-cheeked bully nerd who utters strange noises makes peculiar kung fu gestures and turns up wherever he likes in peoples houses . 111 Donations and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Further information: Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan in May 2013 Zuckerberg founded the Startup:Education foundation. 112 It was reported in September 2010 that he had donated 100 million to Newark Public Schools the public school system of Newark New Jersey . 113 114 Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg. 115 Zuckerberg responded to the criticism saying The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was I didnt want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate . 116 Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerbergs team not to make the donation anonymously. 116 The money was largely wasted according to journalist Dale Russakoff. 117 118 In 2010 Zuckerberg Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffett signed The Giving Pledge in which they said they would donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity. 119 In December 2012 Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan said that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to advancing human potential and promoting equality in the spirit of The Giving Pledge. 120 121 In December 2013 Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation to be executed by the end of the monthbased on Facebooks valuation as of then the shares totaled 990 million in value. Later that month the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for that year. 122 The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazines annual list of 50 most generous Americans for 2013 having donated roughly 1 billion to charity. 123 In October 2014 Zuckerberg and his wife donated 25 million to combat the Ebola virus disease specifically the West African Ebola virus epidemic . 124 125 The couple endowed the foundation of the San Francisco General Hospital in February 2015 with 75 million which was the biggest individual donation to a U.S. public hospital. The hospital honored them by renaming itself as The Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. Later in 2020 the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a near-unanimous non-binding measure condemning the renaming citing concerns that a public hospital should not be named after an individual whose social media platform is accused of endangering public health spreading misinformation and violating privacy . 126 On December 1 2015 the couple pledged to transfer 99 of their Facebook shares then valued at 45 billion to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative CZI. 127 The funds would not be transferred immediately but over the course of their lives. 128 Instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to as Bill Gates Warren Buffett Larry Page Sergey Brin and other billionaires have done Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company LLC . Some journalists and academics have said the CZI conducts philanthrocapitalism . 129 130 131 In 2016 CZI gave 600 million to create the tax-exempt charity Chan Zuckerberg Biohub a collaborative research space in San Franciscos Mission Bay district near the University of California San Francisco with the intent to foster interaction and collaboration between scientists at UCSF University of California Berkeley and Stanford University . Intellectual property generated would be jointly owned by Biohub and the discoverers home institution. Unlike foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which open up all research funded to unrestricted access and reuse by the public Biohub retained the right to commercialize any research it funds. Inventors will have the option of making their discoveries open-source with permission from Biohub. 132 133 134 To increase access to scientific research and promote open science CZ Biohub requires its investigators and staff scientists to publish submitted manuscripts and related data on preprints servers like bioRxiv . 135 136 Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic Zuckerberg donated 25 million to a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation -backed accelerator that is searching for treatments for the disease. 137 He also announced 25 million in grants to support local journalism that was impacted by the pandemic and 75 million in advertisement purchases in local newspapers by Facebook Inc. where Facebook would market itself. 138 Politics With Barack Obama before a private meeting between Obama and technology business leaders in February 2011 In 2002 Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County New York where he grew up but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Then Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman Elma Rosas told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as no preference on voter rolls and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections in 2008 and 2012 . 139 140 Zuckerberg has never revealed his own political affiliation or voting history. In February 2013 Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for then New Jersey Governor Chris Christie . His particular interest on this occasion was education reform and Christies education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools. 141 142 Later that year Zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for then Newark mayor Cory Booker who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election . 143 In September 2010 with the support of Governor Chris Christie Booker obtained a US100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools . 144 In December 2012 Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas. 145 146 With then Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in April 2015 On April 11 2013 Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501c4 lobbying group called FWD.us . The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors and its president was Joe Green a close friend of Zuckerberg. 147 148 The goals of the group include immigration reform improving the state of education in the United States and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public 149 150 yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline. 151 In 2013 numerous liberal and progressive groups such as The League of Conservation Voters MoveOn.org the Sierra Club Democracy for America CREDO Daily Kos 350.org and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either not buy or pull their Facebook ads for at least two weeks in protest of ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform. 152 A media report on June 20 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is just about tech wanting to hire more people the Internet entrepreneur replied: The bigger problem were trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly . 153 In June 2013 Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Pride Celebration . The company first participated in the event in 2011 with 70 employees and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act DOMA unconstitutional. 154 155 With then President Donald Trump at the White House in September 2019 When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013 Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government blew it . He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens the economy and companies. 49 Zuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9 2015 which said that he wants to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world in response to the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2015 San Bernardino attack . 156 157 158 159 The statement also said that Muslims are always welcome on Facebook and that his position was a result of the fact that as a Jew my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities . 160 161 On February 24 2016 Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten Black Lives Matter phrases on the company walls and had written All Lives Matter in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful but malicious as well . According to Zuckerbergs memo Black Lives Matter doesnt mean other lives dont its simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve . The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself means silencing speech or that one persons speech is more important than anothers . Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents. 162 163 164 The New York Daily News interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase Black Lives Matter must exist as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure . 162 In January 2017 Zuckerberg criticized Donald Trumps executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries. 165 He also funded a state-level ballot initiative for the 2020 general election that would raise taxes by altering Californias Proposition 13 to require the tax assessment of commercial and industrial properties in the state at market rate. 166 Especially in his twenties Zuckerberg had financially supported various progressive causes such as immigration reform and social justice. At least among Republicans he was generally seen as pro liberal . In a August 2024 letter to the House Judiciary Committee however Zuckerberg stated he regretted not doing more to resist pressure from the Biden administration to censure content related to COVID-19 . He also noted he no longer intends to donate towards election infrastructure; Republicans had seen those contributions as non neutral labelling them Zuckerbucks . As of 2024 Zuckerberg has been discouraging employee activism at Facebook and accordingly to the New York Times had non-publicly described his politics as leaning towards libertarianism or classical liberalism . 167 168 169 170 Personal life Marriage and children With his wife Priscilla Chan in 2014 Zuckerberg met fellow Harvard student Priscilla Chan at a frat party during his sophomore year with whom he began dating in 2003. 171 In September 2010 Chan who was a medical student at the University of California San Francisco at the time 172 moved into his rented house in Palo Alto California . 173 174 They married on May 19 2012 in the grounds of his mansion in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school. 175 176 Zuckerberg revealed on July 31 2015 that they were expecting a baby girl and that Chan had previously experienced three miscarriages. 177 Their daughter Maxima Chan Zuckerberg was born on December 1 2015. 178 They announced in a Chinese New Year video that their daughters Chinese name is Chen Mingyu Chinese : . 179 Their second daughter August was born in August 2017. 180 Zuckerberg and his wife welcomed their third daughter Aurelia on March 24 2023 and announced the news across his social media pages. 181 The couple also have a Puli dog named Beast 182 who has over two million followers on Facebook. 183 Zuckerberg commissioned the visual artist Daniel Arsham to build a 7-foot-tall sculpture of his wife which was unveiled in 2024. 184 Recognition Time named Zuckerberg one of the most influential people in the world in 2008 2011 2016 and 2019 and nominated him as a finalist several other times. He was named the Time Person of the Year in 2010 the same year when Facebook eclipsed more than half a billion users. 185 He was also included in the Time 100 AI list in 2024. 186 In December 2016 Zuckerberg was ranked tenth on the Forbes list of the Worlds Most Powerful People . 187 In the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2023 he was ranked eighth with a personal wealth of 106 billion. 188 As of October 2024 update Zuckerbergs net worth was estimated at 202 billion by Forbes making him the fourth richest person in the world. 189 Religious beliefs and other interests Raised as a Reform Jew Zuckerberg later identified as an atheist. However he said in 2016 that I went through a period where I questioned things but now I believe religion is very important . 6 190 191 In 2017 he and his wife began a nationwide tour to visit every state in the union and learn more about a sliver of the nearly two billion people who regularly use the social network . He met with farmers and business owners and spoke at Mother Emanuel where a shooting took place in 2015. 192 193 In 2022 Zuckerberg took up training in both mixed martial arts MMA and Brazilian jiu-jitsu BJJ and has been open about his love for the two sports. 194 He competed in a BJJ tournament on May 6 2023 and won both a silver and gold medal in gi and no gi competing at white belt. 195 In July 2023 he was promoted to blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Dave Camarillo. 196 Four months later Zuckerberg announced that he was preparing to make his MMA debut but had suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training that required surgery and had delayed this. 197 See also Mark Zuckerberg book club References Burrell Ian July 24 2010.
