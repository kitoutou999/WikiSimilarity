Early life Brady was born in San Mateo California on August 3 1977 the only son and fourth child of Galynn Patricia nee Johnson and Thomas Brady Sr. 15 Brady was raised as a Catholic . His father is of Irish descent while his mother has Swedish Norwegian German and Polish ancestry. 16 17 In the 1980s Brady regularly attended San Francisco 49ers games at Candlestick Park where he was a fan of quarterback Joe Montana ; Brady called Montana his idol and one of his inspirations. 18 At age four Brady attended the 1981 NFC Championship against the Dallas Cowboys in which Montana threw The Catch to Dwight Clark . 19 As a child Brady attended football camp at the College of San Mateo where he was taught to throw the football by camp counselor and future NFL AFL quarterback Tony Graziani . 20 Despite the rivalry between the two teams Brady grew up as a Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics fan. 21 Brady attended Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo where he graduated in 1995. 22 He played football basketball and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. 23 Brady began his football career as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first Brady was not good enough to start on the 08 junior varsity team which had not scored a touchdown all year. 24 Brady ascended to the starting position when the starting quarterback was injured. He became the varsity starter in his junior year and held the position until he graduated. 25 By Bradys senior year he was striving to be noticed by college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them to schools he considered attending. 26 This led to strong interest from many football programs. The process of recruiting was much different during Bradys time when athletes rankings were not as prominent. In terms of recruiting in the 2000s Brady would have been considered a three or four-star recruit. 27 He was a highly rated prospect. 28 Brady was also on Blue Chip Illustrated as well as a Prep Football Report All-American selection. 29 After his recruiting process he narrowed his list to five schools. 30 Probably the ones that we did hear from and ultimately pared the list to were CalBerkeley UCLA USC Michigan and Illinois his father said. 30 As a Cal-Berkeley fan his father hoped that Brady would attend the nearby school where Brady was a silent commit and that he would be able to watch his son play. 31 32 Brady was also known as a great baseball player in high school. 33 He was a left-handed-batting catcher with power. His skills impressed MLB scouts and he was drafted in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB Draft by the Montreal Expos 24 34 after the team brought Brady to Candlestick Park to work out with players a very unusual decision. 35 The Expos projected Brady as a potential All-Star with then-GM Kevin Malone claiming that he had the potential to be one of the greatest catchers ever . 36 The team offered him money typical of that offered to a late second-round or early third-round pick 37 but Brady was recruited by Michigan football assistant Bill Harris signing to play for the University of Michigan in 1995. 30 38 Brady would become the last active athlete drafted by the Expos. 39 He finished his high school football career by completing 236 of 447 passes for 3 702 yards and 31 touchdowns. 40 Brady also won All-State and All-Far West honors and the teams Most Valuable Player Award. 41 During summer 1998 and 1999 Brady was an intern at Merrill Lynch . 42 He was inducted into the Junipero Serra High School Hall of Fame in 2003. 41 When Brady visited the school in 2012 two weeks after Super Bowl XLVI administrators announced that they named the football stadium Brady Family Stadium. 43 College career Brady playing for the Michigan Wolverines 1999 Brady played college football at the University of Michigan for the Wolverines from 1995 to 1999. 44 45 After redshirting in 1995 46 Brady spent the next two years as a backup quarterback while teammate and future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season which was capped by a victory in the Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship . 47 When he initially enrolled at Michigan Brady was seventh on the depth chart and struggled to get playing time. 48 At one point Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety; he even considered transferring to the University of California Berkeley . 49 50 He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and to maximize his performance. 51 Brady told 60 Minutes in 2014: He will always be somebody I rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really pushed me in a direction that I wasnt sure I could go. 52 On September 28 1996 Brady appeared in his first collegiate game after Michigan was up 353 against UCLA late in the fourth quarter. His first-ever pass attempt was intercepted by Phillip Ward and returned for a 42-yard touchdown. 53 Under Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr Brady battled for the starting job with Drew Henson 45 and ultimately started every game in the 1998 and 1999 seasons . Brady was All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention both seasons and was the team captain in his senior year. 54 During his first full year as the starter he set new Michigan records for most pass attempts and completions in a season for a total of 214. 55 He set a school record for completions in a 3116 loss against Ohio State in 1998 a season in which Michigan shared the Big Ten title. 56 Brady capped that season with a 4531 win over Arkansas in the Citrus Bowl . 57 In the 1999 season Brady had to once again hold off Henson for the starting job. The two players platooned during the seasons first seven games with Brady playing the first quarter Henson the second and Carr then deciding upon a quarterback for the second half. The 1999 Michigan Wolverines started with a 50 record including a 2622 win over Notre Dame and a road win against eventual powerhouse Wisconsin . 58 Against Michigan State Brady was not chosen to play the second half; however after being reinserted into the game with Michigan down by 17 points he nearly led Michigan all the way back before losing 3431. 59 After a 300-yard passing game the following week Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder of the season. On October 30 against Indiana Brady played the entire game for the first time in the season and threw for 226 yards his fifth straight game throwing for 200 yards to lead Michigan out of a close game which ended in a 3431 win. 60 Against Penn State Brady led Michigan to another 4th-quarter comeback in a 3127 win heading into the regular seasons final game as winners of three straight. 61 Michigan concluded the regular season against Ohio State ; this was a dramatic game with a trip to the Orange Bowl on the line. With five minutes left tied 1717 Brady led Michigan to the winning score. 62 He led Michigan to an overtime win in the Orange Bowl over Alabama throwing for 369 yards and four touchdowns leading the team back from a pair of 14-point deficits in regulation 140 in the first half and 2814 in the second. He threw the game-winning score on a bootleg play to tight end Shawn Thompson. Michigan won the game when Alabama missed an extra point following its touchdown. 63 In the two seasons that Brady started at Michigan he posted a 205 record including wins at the 1999 Citrus Bowl and the 2000 Orange Bowl .

Brady is the NFLs oldest quarterback to be named to the Pro Bowl age 44 be named Super Bowl MVP age 43 win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback age 43 and be named league MVP age 40. 85 86 Up until his retirement he was the last player drafted before 2004 on an NFL roster. 87 88 89 90 A game-worn jersey of Bradys in the Pro Football Hall of Fame On the Patriots Brady and head coach Bill Belichick formed the NFLs most successful quarterbackhead coach tandem. 91 They were consistently credited with the Patriots dynasty from 2001 to 2019 resulting in the dynasty being named the BradyBelichick era after them. 92 93 94 95 96 The dynasty is regarded as one of the greatest in sports history with Bradys successes helping the Patriots set the records for Super Bowl appearances 11 and wins 6 tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers . 97 During Bradys first season as the primary starter the franchise won its first championship in Super Bowl XXXVI with consecutive titles following in 2003 and 2004 . 98 99 The Patriots won an NFL-record 21 consecutive games regular season and playoffs during this period while Brady won 10 consecutive postseason games also his first 10 postseason games another NFL record. 100 101 Brady maintained the Patriots status as perennial postseason contenders throughout his tenure although they did not win another Super Bowl until a decade after their third. His next two appearances both ended in upset defeats to the New York Giants ; the first loss in 2007s Super Bowl XLII also prevented Brady and the Patriots from obtaining a perfect 190 season. 102 Brady returned to dominant postseason form in 2014 when he led the Patriots to their fourth title in Super Bowl XLIX . 103 This was followed by Brady making three consecutive Super Bowl appearances from 2016 to 2018 which secured New Englands fifth and sixth titles in Super Bowl LI and Super Bowl LIII . 104 When Brady signed with Tampa Bay in 2020 the team had not reached the postseason since 2007 or won a playoff game since 2002. 105 Brady helped end both droughts en route to the Buccaneers winning Super Bowl LV . 106 In 2021 he set the season record for completions and led the league in passing yards and touchdowns; his passing yards were also a career-high. 107 In his final season despite finishing with a losing record for the first time Brady broke his single-season completion record and set the season record for attempts. 108 One of the NFLs most decorated and accomplished players Brady is widely cited as the greatest quarterback of all time. 3 He is one of NFLs greatest players of all time 109 110 111 112 and one of the greatest athletes in sports history. 113 114 115 116 New England Patriots 20002004: Rookie season and initial Super Bowl runs 2000: Draft and rookie season on the bench Pre-draft measurables Height Weight Arm length Hand span 40-yard dash 10-yard split 20-yard split 20-yard shuttle Three-cone drill Vertical jump Broad jump Wonderlic 6 ft 4 3 8 in 1.94 m 211 lb 96 kg 32 3 4 in 0.83 m 9 3 8 in 0.24 m 5.28 s 1.75 s 2.99 s 4.38 s 7.20 s 24.5 in 0.62 m 8 ft 3 in 2.51 m 33 117 All values from NFL Combine 118 119 120 Brady was a lightly regarded prospect coming out of college 121 with an unimpressive NFL Scouting Combine performance reinforcing this reputation. 122 As a result he was not selected until the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft by the New England Patriots 199th overall a compensatory pick the Patriots earned due to the loss of punter Tom Tupa to free agency in 1999 123 and was the seventh quarterback taken. He and his family believed Brady would be drafted in the second or third round; they watched the draft on television stunned as six other quarterbacks were drafted before he was. Brady was so embarrassed he briefly left the family home during the sixth round and cried when recalling the experience for an interview 11 years later. Brady later said that when the Patriots notified him that he would be drafted he was grateful he would not have to be an insurance salesman . 124 According to Michael Holley s book Patriot Reign the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay both of whom had received positive reviews from then-quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein . 125 Ultimately the Patriots front office chose Brady. Considering his subsequent success many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time. 126 127 128 129 Patriots owner Robert Kraft recalled: I still have the image of Tom Brady coming down the old Foxboro Stadium steps with that pizza box under his arm a skinny beanpole and when he introduced himself to me and said Hi Mr. Kraft he was about to say who he was but I said I know who you are youre Tom Brady. Youre our sixth round draft choice recalled Kraft. And he looked me in the eye and said Im the best decision this organization has ever made. It looks like he could be right. 130 Brady started the 2000 season as the fourth-string quarterback behind starter Drew Bledsoe and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop ; by the end of the season he was number two on the depth chart behind Bledsoe. 131 During his rookie season he was 1-for-3 passing for six yards. 132 Tight end Rod Rutledge caught Bradys first and only completed pass of the season in a 349 loss to the Detroit Lions on November 23. 133 134 2001: Taking over as starter and first Super Bowl victory With Bledsoe as the starting quarterback the Patriots opened the 2001 season with a 2317 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals . 135 In their second game and home opener on September 23 the Patriots squared off against their AFC East rivals the New York Jets . Bledsoe was again the starter; in the fourth quarter he suffered internal bleeding after a hit from Jets linebacker Mo Lewis . Bledsoe returned for the next series but was replaced with Brady for the Patriots final series of the game. New York held on to win 103 and the Patriots fell to 02 on the season. 136 Brady was named the starter for the seasons third game against the Indianapolis Colts in which the Patriots posted a 4413 win. 137 138 In the Patriots fifth game Brady began to find his stride. Trailing the visiting San Diego Chargers 2616 in the fourth quarter he led the Patriots on two scoring drives to force overtime and another in overtime to set up a winning field goal for a 2926 victory. Brady finished the game with 33 of 54 for 364 yards and two touchdowns and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the first time in his career. 139 140 The following week Brady again played well during the rematch at Indianapolis with a passer rating of 148.3 in a 3817 win. 141 Brady won his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nomination after a four-touchdown day in a 3417 win over the New Orleans Saints in Week 11. 142 The Patriots went on to win eleven of the fourteen games Brady started and six straight to finish the regular season winning the AFC East and entering the NFL playoffs with a first-round bye. 143 He finished the 2001 season with 2 843 passing yards and 18 touchdowns earning an invitation to the Pro Bowl . 144 145 In Bradys first playoff game he threw for 312 yards against the Oakland Raiders and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime where they won on an Adam Vinatieri field goal 1613. A controversial play occurred in the fourth quarter of that game. Trailing by three points Brady lost control of the ball after being hit by Raiders cornerback and former Michigan teammate Charles Woodson . Oakland initially recovered the ball but citing the tuck rule which states that any forward throwing motion by a quarterback begins a pass even if the quarterback loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body referee Walt Coleman overturned the call on instant replay ruling it an incomplete pass rather than a fumble. 146 Brady finished the game 32-of-52 for 312 passing yards and one interception. 147 In the AFC Championship Game against the Steelers Brady injured his knee and was relieved by Bledsoe. The Patriots won the game by a score of 2417. 148 Subsequently Las Vegas oddsmakers positioned them as 14-point underdogs against the NFC champion St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI . 149 Brady returned from his knee injury in the AFC Championship Game to start in the Super Bowl a week later at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans . Despite being heavy underdogs the Patriots played well holding the Rams high-powered offense in check through the first three quarters. The Rams rallied from a 173 deficit to tie the game with 1:30 left in regulation. The Patriots then got the ball back at their own 17-yard line with no timeouts remaining. Sportscaster and former Super Bowl-winning coach John Madden argued that the Patriots should run out the clock and try to win the game in overtime. 150 Instead Brady drove the Patriots offense down the field to the Rams 31-yard line before spiking the ball with seven seconds left.

On May 11 Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on substantial and credible evidence that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he was uncooperative with the investigators. 309 That day Troy Vincent NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operationspenned a letter to Brady that stated in part: Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football. 310 Brady through the NFL Players Association appealed the suspension on May 14. 311 On July 28 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld Bradys four-game suspension. 312 Goodell cited Bradys destruction of his cell phone as a critical factor in his decision to uphold Bradys suspension. 313 314 The NFL also filed papers in federal court seeking to confirm Roger Goodells decision. 315 Brady gave permission to the NFLPA to appeal the suspension in federal court 316 and released a statement on his Facebook page that expressed disappointment in and criticism of Goodells decision to uphold the suspension. 317 318 Commentary on the initial punishment was mixed. Bleacher Report writer Mike Freeman made a statement agreeing with Goodells decision saying the penalties were brutal but it deserved to be. 319 Various commentators also implied that the prior reputation of the Patriots organization as a team that bends rules appeared to factor into the harshness of the punishment. 319 320 Others described the punishment as firm but fair . 321 On September 3 Judge Richard M. Berman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated Bradys suspension; this ruling allowed Brady to play in the first four games of the 2015 NFL season .
