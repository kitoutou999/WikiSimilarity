Jacksons early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included Everyday People 1968 Len Barry s 1-2-3 1965 and Dion DiMucci s The Wanderer 1961 and Runaround Sue 1961. In 1984 Robert Holmes a Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4 000 songs including most of the Beatles material. 103 In 1981 McCartney had been offered the catalog for 20 million 40 million equivalent to 134 million in 2023. 98 104 Jackson submitted a bid of 46 million equivalent to 135 million in 2023 on November 20 1984. 103 When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint purchase McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles songs and did not pursue an offer on his own. 105 104 Jacksons agents were unable to come to a deal and in May 1985 left talks after having spent more than 1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations. 103 In June 1985 Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman s and Marty Bandier s The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to buy ATV Music for 50 million; in early August Holmes a Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jacksons increased bid of 47.5 million equivalent to 135 million in 2023 was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly having already completed due diligence. 103 Jackson agreed to visit Holmes a Court in Australia where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon . 106 His purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10 1985. 98 103 Increased tabloid speculation 19861987 See also: Health and appearance of Michael Jackson Jacksons skin had been medium-brown during his youth but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin . 107 108 109 His dermatologist Arnold Klein said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo 110 a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. He also identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year 110 and with vitiligo in 1986. 111 Vitiligos drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup 112 and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams 113 to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would depigment the blotches and with the application of makeup he could appear very pale. 114 Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo adding When people make up stories that I dont want to be who I am it hurts me. 115 He became friends with Klein and Kleins assistant Debbie Rowe . Rowe later became Jacksons second wife and the mother of his first two children. 116 In his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview Jackson said he had had two rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft chin surgery but no more than that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a dancers body. 117 Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy and speculated he was suffering from anorexia nervosa . Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his life. 118 After his death Jacksons mother said that he first turned to cosmetic procedures to remedy his vitiligo because he did not want to look like a spotted cow . She said he had received more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had become addicted to them. 119 In 1986 it was reported that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow aging. He denied the story 120 although it was alleged that Jackson leaked an image of him sleeping in a glass chamber according to Jackson this was a promotional shot from an upcoming space opera featuring himself to The National Enquirer . 121 It was also reported that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy proposed to Elizabeth Taylor and possibly had a shrine of her and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jacksons manager Frank DiLeo denied all of them except for Jackson having a chamber. DiLeo added I dont know if he sleeps in it. Im not for it. But Michael thinks its something thats probably healthy for him. Hes a bit of a health fanatic. 122 When Jackson took his pet chimpanzee Bubbles to tour in Japan the media portrayed Jackson as an aspiring Disney cartoon character who befriended animals. 123 It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick the Elephant Man . 124 In June 1987 the Chicago Tribune reported Jacksons publicist bidding 1 million for the skeleton to the London Hospital Medical College on his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was not for sale. DiLeo said Jackson had an absorbing interest in Merrick purely based on his awareness of the ethical medical and historical significance. 125 In September 1986 using the oxygen chamber story the British tabloid The Sun branded Jackson Wacko Jacko a name Jackson came to despise. 4 126 The Atlantic noted that the name Jacko has racist connotations as it originates from Jacko Macacco a monkey used in monkey-baiting matches at the Westminster Pit in the early 1820s and Jacko was used in Cockney slang to refer to monkeys in general. 127 Jackson worked with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute 30 million 3D film Captain EO which ran from 1986 at Disneyland and Epcot and later at Tokyo Disneyland and Euro Disneyland . 128 After having been removed in the late 1990s it returned to the theme park for several years after Jacksons death. 129 In 1987 Ebony reported that Jackson had disassociated himself from the Jehovahs Witnesses. 130 Katherine Jackson said this might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the Thriller video 131 which Michael denounced in a Witness publication in 1984. 132 In 2001 Jackson told an interviewer he was still a Jehovahs Witness. 133 Bad autobiography and Neverland 19871990 Jackson and President George H. W. Bush at the White House on April 5 1990. It was the second time that Jackson had been honored by a president of the United States.

For much of Jacksons career he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation. 420 His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance led fashion trends and raised awareness for global affairs. 421 Jacksons music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTVs roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and RB leading to the discontinuation of the album-oriented rock format previously dominant on the channel. 38 422 In songs such as Black or White Heal the World Earth Song and They Dont Care About Us Jacksons music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice. 423 424 He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records . 425 426 Jackson has also appeared on Rolling Stone s lists of the Greatest Singers of All Time. 427 428 He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century 429 and his contributions to music dance and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. 430 431 432 Trying to trace Michael Jacksons influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast far-reaching and was his impactparticularly in the wake of Thriller s colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial successthat there werent a whole lot of artists who werent trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula. J. Edward Keyes of Rolling Stone 433 Danyel Smith chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in-chief of Vibe described Jackson as the greatest star . 434 Steve Huey of AllMusic called him an unstoppable juggernaut possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice eye-popping dance moves stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power . 4 BET said Jackson was quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time whose sound style movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres . 435 Jacksons Bad era wax figure at Madame Tussauds London in 1992 In 1984 Time pop critic Jay Cocks wrote that Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever. He described Jackson as a star of records radio rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too. 87 In 2003 The Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley described Jackson as extremely important and a genius . 436 At Jacksons memorial service on July 7 2009 Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson the greatest entertainer that ever lived . 437 438 In a June 28 2009 Baltimore Sun article Jill Rosen wrote that Jacksons legacy influenced fields including sound dance fashion music videos and celebrity. 439 Pop critic Robert Christgau wrote that Jacksons work from the 1970s to the early 1990s showed immense originality adaptability and ambition with genius beats hooks arrangements and vocals though not lyrics music that will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and thats the end of it . During the 1990s as Jackson lost control of his troubling life his music suffered and began to shape an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo . 440 In the 2000s Christgau wrote: Jacksons obsession with fame his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that hes a great musician is now often forgotten . 441 Philanthropy and humanitarian work Main article: Philanthropy of Michael Jackson President Ronald Reagan rewarding Jackson in 1984 for his support of alcohol and drug abuse charities Jackson is widely regarded as having been a prolific philanthropist and humanitarian. 442 443 444 445 Jacksons early charitable work has been described by The Chronicle of Philanthropy as having paved the way for the current surge in celebrity philanthropy 446 and by the Los Angeles Times as having set the standard for generosity for other entertainers . 442 By some estimates he donated over 500 million not accounting for inflation to various charities over the course of his life. 442 In 1992 Jackson established his Heal the World Foundation to which he donated several million dollars in revenue from his Dangerous World Tour . 447 Jacksons philanthropic activities went beyond just monetary donations. He also performed at benefit concerts some of which he arranged. He gifted tickets for his regular concert performances to groups that assist underprivileged children. He visited sick children in hospitals around the world. He opened his own home for visits by underprivileged or sick children and provided special facilities and nurses if the children needed that level of care. Jackson donated valuable personal and professional paraphernalia for numerous charity auctions. He received various awards and accolades for his philanthropic work including two bestowed by presidents of the United States . The vast breadth of Jacksons philanthropic work has earned recognition in the Guinness World Records . 442 448 449 On May 14 1984 President Ronald Reagan gave Jackson an award recognizing his support of alcohol and drug abuse charities 450 and in recognition of his support for the Ad Council s and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration s Drunk Driving Prevention campaign. Jackson allowed the campaign to use Beat It for its public service announcements. 451 Artistry Influences Jackson was influenced by musicians including James Brown Little Richard Jackie Wilson Diana Ross Fred Astaire Sammy Davis Jr . Gene Kelly 452 and David Ruffin . 453 Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson 454 but Brown was his greatest inspiration. When Jackson was a small child his mother would wake him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being mesmerized . 455 Jacksons vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the oooh interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many of her songs with the Supremes . 456 She was a mother figure to him and he often watched her rehearse. 457 He said he had learned a lot from watching how she moved and sang and that she had encouraged him to have confidence in himself. 458 Choreographer David Winters who met Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana! said that Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in Beat It and the Bad video. 459 460 461 Vocal style Jackson sang from childhood and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975 his voice descended from boy soprano to lyric tenor . 462 He was known for his vocal range. 427 With the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s Jacksons abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Rolling Stone compared his vocals to the breathless dreamy stutter of Stevie Wonder and wrote that Jacksons feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto thats used very daringly. 463 By the time of 1982s Thriller Rolling Stone wrote that Jackson was singing in a fully adult voice that was tinged by sadness . 464 The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album Dangerous . The New York Times noted that on some tracks he gulps for breath his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper hissing through clenched teeth and he had a wretched tone . When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to smooth vocals. 465 Of Invincible Rolling Stone wrote that at 43 Jackson still performed exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies . 466 Joseph Vogel notes Jacksons ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion. 467 Neil McCormick wrote that Jacksons unorthodox singing style was original and utterly distinctive . 468 Musicianship Jackson had no formal music training and could not read or write music notation . He is credited for playing guitar keyboard and drums but was not proficient in them. 469 When composing he recorded ideas by beatboxing and imitating instruments vocally. 469 Describing the process he said: Ill just sing the bass part into the tape recorder. Ill take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and thats what inspires the melody. The engineer Robert Hoffman recalled that after Jackson came in with a song he had written overnight Jackson sang every note of every chord to a guitar player. Hoffman also remembered Jackson singing string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder. 469 Dance Jackson danced from a young age as part of the Jackson 5 470 and incorporated dance extensively in his performances and music videos. 470 According to Sanjoy Roy of The Guardian Jackson would flick and retract his limbs like switchblades or snap out of a tornado spin into a perfectly poised toe-stand . 470 The moonwalk taught to him by Jeffrey Daniel 77 was Jacksons signature dance move and one of the most famous of the 20th century. 471 Jackson is credited for coining the name moonwalk for this street dance move previously known as the backslide . 472 473 His other moves included the robot 44 474 crotch grab and the anti-gravity lean of the Smooth Criminal video. 470 Themes and genres Jackson during his Bad World Tour in Vienna June 1988 Jackson explored genres including pop 4 475 soul 4 154 rhythm and blues 475 funk 476 rock 475 476 disco 477 post-disco 476 dance-pop 478 and new jack swing . 4 Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall ; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. 4 Its tracks included the ballads The Lady in My Life Human Nature and The Girl Is Mine 479 464 480 the funk pieces Billie Jean and Wanna Be Startin Somethin 479 464 and the disco set Baby Be Mine and P.Y.T. Pretty Young Thing . 480 With Off the Wall Jacksons vocabulary of grunts squeals hiccups moans and asides vividly showed his maturation into an adult Robert Christgau wrote in Christgaus Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies 1981. The albums title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder s oddball music personas: Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed. 481 With Thriller Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. 464 AllMusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs Billie Jean and Wanna Be Startin Somethin . 479 In Billie Jean Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child 4 and in Wanna Be Startin Somethin he argues against gossip and the media. 464 Beat It decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story and was Jacksons first successful rock cross-over piece according to Huey. 4 35 He observed that Thriller began Jacksons interest with the theme of the supernatural a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985 Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem We Are the World ; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona. 4 Jacksons Bad era jacket on display at the Hollywood Guinness World Records Museum In Bad Jacksons concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song Dirty Diana . 482 The lead single I Just Cant Stop Loving You is a traditional love ballad and Man in the Mirror is a ballad of confession and resolution. Smooth Criminal is an evocation of bloody assault rape and likely murder. 134 AllMusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a paradoxical person. 483 The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing including songs like Jam and Remember the Time . It was the first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary theme; Why You Wanna Trip on Me for example protests world hunger AIDS homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as In the Closet . The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective pop-gospel anthems such as Will You Be There Heal the World and Keep the Faith . 465 In the ballad Gone Too Soon Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS. 484 HIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia. 485 In the new jack swing-funk rock tracks Scream and Tabloid Junkie and the RB ballad You Are Not Alone Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels and directs his anger at the media. 486 In the introspective ballad Stranger in Moscow Jackson laments his fall from grace ; Earth Song Childhood Little Susie and Smile are operatic pop songs. 485 486 In D.S. Jackson attacks lawyer Thomas W. Sneddon Jr. who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases; he describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who wanted to get my ass dead or alive . 487 Invincible includes urban soul tracks such as Cry and The Lost Children ballads such as Speechless Break of Dawn and Butterflies and mixes hip hop pop and RB in 2000 Watts Heartbreaker and Invincible . 488 489 Music videos and choreography Jackson center performing a dance sequence of The Way You Make Me Feel at the Bad World Tour in 1988 Jackson released Thriller a 14-minute music video directed by John Landis in 1983. 490 The zombie -themed video defined music videos and broke racial barriers on MTV which had launched two years earlier. 38 Before Thriller Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV allegedly because he was African American. 491 Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing Billie Jean and later Beat It which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson and helped other black music artists gain recognition. 492 The popularity of his videos on MTV helped the relatively new channels viewing figures and MTVs focus shifted toward pop and RB. 492 493 His performance on Motown 25: Yesterday Today Forever changed the scope of live stage shows making it acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on stage. 494 The choreography in Thriller has been copied in Indian films and prisons in the Philippines . 495 Thriller marked an increase in scale for music videos and was named the most successful music video ever by the Guinness World Records . 222 In Bad s 19-minute videodirected by Martin Scorsese Jackson used sexual imagery and choreography and touched his chest torso and crotch. When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch he said it was spontaneously compelled by the music. Time magazine described the Bad video as infamous . It featured Wesley Snipes ; Jacksons later videos often featured famous cameo roles. 496 497 For the Smooth Criminal video Jackson experimented with leaning forward at a 45-degree angle beyond the performers center of gravity. To accomplish this live Jackson and designers developed a special shoe to lock the performers feet to the stage allowing them to lean forward. They were granted U.S. patent 5 255 452 for the device. 498 The video for Leave Me Alone was not officially released in the US but in 1989 was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards 499 and won a Golden Lion Award for its special effects. It won a Grammy for Best Music Video Short Form . 59 He received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1988; in 2001 the award was renamed in his honor. 500 The Black or White video simultaneously premiered on November 14 1991 in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people the largest audience ever for a music video at the time. 170 Along with Jackson it featured Macaulay Culkin Peggy Lipton and George Wendt . It helped introduce morphing to music videos. 501 It was controversial for scenes in which Jackson rubs his crotch vandalizes cars and throws a garbage can through a storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the video. 158 In the Closet featured Naomi Campbell in a courtship dance with Jackson. 502 Remember the Time was set in ancient Egypt and featured Eddie Murphy Iman and Magic Johnson . 503 The video for Scream directed by Mark Romanek and production designer Tom Foden gained a record 11 MTV Video Music Award Nominations and won Best Dance Video Best Choreography and Best Art Direction . 504 The song and its video are Jacksons response to being accused of child molestation in 1993. 505 A year later it won a Grammy for Best Music Video Short Form. It has been reported as the most expensive music video ever made at 7 million; 506 Romanek has contradicted this. 507 The Earth Song video was nominated for the 1997 Grammy for Best Music Video Short Form. 508 Michael Jacksons Ghosts a short film written by Jackson and Stephen King and directed by Stan Winston premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival . At over 38 minutes long it held the Guinness world record for the longest music video until 2013 when it was eclipsed by the video for the Pharrell Williams song Happy . 509 The 2001 video for You Rock My World lasts over 13 minutes was directed by Paul Hunter and features Chris Tucker and Marlon Brando . 510 It won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Music Video in 2002. 511 In December 2009 the Library of Congress selected Thriller as the only music video to be preserved in the National Film Registry as a work of enduring importance to American culture . 512 513 Huey wrote that Jackson transformed the music video into an artform and a promotional tool through complex story lines dance routines special effects and famous cameos while breaking down racial barriers. 4 Honors and awards See also: List of awards and nominations received by Michael Jackson Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists in history 514 with sales estimated around 500 million records worldwide. 515 Note 2 He had 13 number-one singles in the US in his solo careermore than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era until Drake tied with Jackson with First Person Shooter . 516 He was invited and honored by a president of the United States at the White House three times.
