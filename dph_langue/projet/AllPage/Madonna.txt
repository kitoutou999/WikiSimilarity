She was known for her high grade point average GPA and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. Madonna would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess and pull up her skirt during classall so that the boys could see her underwear. 11 She later admitted to seeing herself in her youth as a lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasnt rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didnt shave my underarms or legs and I didnt wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades... I wanted to be somebody. 4 Madonnas father put her in classical piano lessons but she later convinced him to allow her to take ballet lessons. 12 Christopher Flynn her ballet teacher persuaded her to pursue a career in dance. 13 Madonna later attended Rochester Adams High School and became a straight-A student as well as a member of its cheerleading squad. 14 15 After graduating in January 1976 she received a dance scholarship to the University of Michigan and studied over the summer at the American Dance Festival in Durham North Carolina . 16 17 In 1978 Madonna dropped out of college and relocated to New York City. 18 She said of her move to New York It was the first time Id ever taken a plane the first time Id ever gotten a taxi cab.

The album was released in July 1983 and peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 .

Critics and fans reacted negatively commenting that she had gone too far and her career was over. 142 Around this time Madonna briefly dated rapper Tupac Shakur and basketball player Dennis Rodman . 143 144 145 Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli described her ballad Ill Remember 1994 as an attempt to tone down her provocative image. The song was recorded for Alek Keshishian s 1994 film With Honors . 146 She made a subdued appearance with Letterman at an awards show and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno after realizing that she needed to change her musical direction to sustain her popularity. 147 With her sixth studio album Bedtime Stories 1994 Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception. 147 The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and generated two US top-five hits Secret and Take a Bow the latter topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks the longest period of any Madonna single. 148 Something to Remember a collection of ballads was released in November 1995.

I put everything of me into this because it was much more than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done. Madonna talking about her role in Evita 153 In February 1996 Madonna began filming the musical Evita in Argentina. 154 For a long time Madonna had desired to play Argentine political leader Eva Peron and wrote to director Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. After securing the title role she received vocal coaching and learned about the history of Argentina and Peron. During filming Madonna became ill several times after finding out that she was pregnant and from the intense emotional effort required with the scenes. 155 Upon Evita s release in December 1996 Madonnas performance received praise from film critics. 156 157 158 Zach Conner of Time magazine remarked Its a relief to say that Evita is pretty damn fine well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. 159 For the role she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . 160 The Evita soundtrack containing songs mostly performed by Madonna was released as a double album . 161 It included You Must Love Me and Dont Cry for Me Argentina ; the latter reached number one in countries across Europe. 162 Madonna was presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards . 163 On October 14 1996 she gave birth to Lourdes Lola Maria Ciccone Leon her daughter with fitness trainer Carlos Leon. 164 165 Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna often worried that her pregnancy would harm Evita she reached some important personal goals: Now 38 years old Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career reinventing herself and her image with the public. 166 Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997 and she declared that they were better off as best friends . 167 168 19982002: Ray of Light Music second marriage and touring comeback After Lourdess birth Madonna became involved in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah introduced to her by actress Sandra Bernhard . 169 Her seventh studio album Ray of Light 1998 reflected this change in her perception and image. 170 171 She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and wanted to create a sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. 172 American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave were happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental more hard stuff like Aphex Twin . There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim . Thats not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter really. And William Orbit provided her with that. 172 The album garnered critical acclaim with Slant Magazine calling it one of the great pop masterpieces of the 90s 173 Ray of Light was honored with four Grammy Awards including Best Pop Album and Best Dance Recording and was nominated for both Album of the Year and Record of the Year . 174 Rolling Stone listed it among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . 175 Commercially the album peaked at number-one in numerous countries and sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. 176 The albums lead single Frozen became Madonnas first single to debut at number one in the UK while in the US it became her sixth number-two single setting another record for Madonna as the artist with the most number-two hits. 50 177 The second single Ray of Light debuted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. 178 The 1998 edition of Guinness Book of World Records documented that no female artist has sold more records than Madonna around the world . 179 Madonna founded Ray of Light Foundation which focused on women education global development and humanitarian. 180 She recorded the single Beautiful Stranger for the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me which earned her a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture Television or Other Visual Media . 116 Madonna starred in the 2000 comedy-drama film The Next Best Thing directed by John Schlesinger . The film opened at number two on the US box office with 5.9 million grossed in its first week but this quickly diminished. 181 She also contributed two songs to the films soundtracka cover of Don McLean s 1971 song American Pie and an original song Time Stood Still the former became her ninth UK number-one single. 182 Madonna performing at the 2001 Drowned World Tour the highest-grossing tour of the year by a solo artist Madonna released her eighth studio album Music in September 2000. 183 It featured elements from the electronica -inspired Ray of Light era and like its predecessor received acclaim from critics.

Both. 366 Her Material Girl music video recreated Monroes look in the song Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes 1953. She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s particularly those of Lombard in preparation for the film Whos That Girl . The video for Express Yourself 1989 was inspired by Fritz Lang s silent film Metropolis 1927. The video for Vogue recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs in particular those by Horst P. Horst and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich Carole Lombard and Rita Hayworth while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her including Bette Davis described by Madonna as an idol. 115 379 Influences also came to her from the art world such as through the works of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo . 380 The music video of the song Bedtime Story featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and Remedios Varo . 381 Madonna is also a collector of Tamara de Lempicka s Art Deco paintings and has included them in her music videos and tours. 382 Her video for Hollywood 2003 was an homage to the work of photographer Guy Bourdin ; Bourdins son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorized use of his fathers work. 383 Pop artist Andy Warhol s use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for Erotica and Deeper and Deeper . 384 Madonnas Catholic background has been reflected throughout her career from her fashion use of rosary to her musical outputs including on Like a Prayer 1989. 385 386 Her album MDNA 2012 has also drawn many influences from her Catholic upbringing and since 2011 she has been attending meetings and services at an Opus Dei center a Catholic institution that encourages spirituality through everyday life. 387 In a 2016 interview she commented: I always feel some kind of inexplicable connection with Catholicism.

Grant author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis 2005 commented that Madonnas musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. 393 Thomas Harrison in the book Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties deemed Madonna an artist who pushed the boundaries of what a female singer could do both visually and lyrically. 394 Professor Santiago Fouz-Hernandez asserted While not gifted with an especially powerful or wide-ranging voice Madonna has worked to expand her artistic palette to encompass diverse musical textual and visual styles and various vocal guises all with the intention of presenting herself as a mature musician. 395 Madonna has remained in charge in every aspect of her career including as a writer and producer in most of her own music. 396 397 Her desire for control had already been seen during the making of her debut album where she fought Reggie Lucas over his production output. However it was not until her third album that Warner allowed Madonna to produce her own album. 398 Stan Hawkins author of Settling the Pop Score explained it is as musician and producer that Madonna is one of the few female artists to have broken into the male domain of the recording studio. Undoubtedly Madonna is fully aware that women have been excluded from the musical workplace on most levels and has set out to change this. 399 Producer Stuart Price stated: You dont produce Madonna you collaborate with her... She has her vision and knows how to get it. 400 Despite being labeled a control freak Madonna has said that she valued input from her collaborators. 401 She further explained: I like to have control over most of the things in my career but Im not a tyrant . I dont have to have it on my album that its written arranged produced directed and stars Madonna. To me to have total control means you can lose objectivity. What I like is to be surrounded by really talented intelligent people that you can trust. And ask them for their advice and get their input. 402 Madonnas early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. 403 She subsequently became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album including Lucky Star which she composed on synthesizer. 404 As a songwriter Madonna has registered more than 300 tracks to American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers ASCAP including 18 songs written entirely by herself. 405 Rolling Stone has named her an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics. 406 Despite having worked with producers across many genres the magazine noted that Madonnas compositions have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. 407 Patrick Leonard who co-wrote many of her hit songs called Madonna a helluva songwriter explaining: Her sensibility about melodic line from the beginning of the verse to the end of the verse and how the verse and the chorus influence each otheris very deep. Many times shes singing notes that no one wouldve thought of but her. 408 Barry Walters from Spin credited her songwriting as the reason of her musical consistency. 409 Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times. 410 In 2015 Rolling Stone ranked Madonna at number 56 on the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time list. 407 Live to Tell 1986 Madonna wrote all the lyrics and partial melodies of Live to Tell an adult contemporary ballad which was noted as her first musical reinvention. 411 Ray of Light 1998 An uptempo electronic dance song Ray of Light showcases Madonnas post- Evita upper vocal register . 412 Problems playing these files? See media help . Madonnas discography is generally categorized as pop electronica and dance. 413 414 Nevertheless Madonnas first foray into the music industry was dabbling in rock music with Breakfast Club and Emmy. 415 As the frontwoman of Emmy Madonna recorded about 1214 songs that resemble the punk rock of that period. 403 Madonna soon abandoned playing rock songs by the time she signed to Gotham Records which eventually dropped her since they were unhappy with her new funk direction. 416 According to Erlewine Madonna began her career as a disco diva in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the 1980s disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop and Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. 417 Arie Kaplan in the book American Pop: Hit Makers Superstars and Dance Revolutionaries referred to Madonna as a pioneer of dance-pop . 418 According to Fouz-Hernandez Madonnas frequent use of dance idioms and subsequent association with gay or sexually liberated audiences is seen as somehow inferior to real rock and roll . But Madonnas music refuses to be defined by narrow boundaries of gender sexuality or anything else. 395 The cold and emotional ballad Live to Tell as well as its parent album True Blue 1986 is noted as Madonnas first musical reinvention. 411 PopMatters writer Peter Piatkowski described it as a very deliberate effort to present Madonna as a mature and serious artist. 419 She continued producing ballads in between her upbeat material although albums such as Madonna 1983 and Confessions on a Dance Floor 2005 consist of entirely dance tracks. 420 421 With Ray of Light 1998 critics acknowledged Madonna for bringing electronica from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene. 422 Her other sonically drastic ventures include the 1930s big-band jazz on Im Breathless 1990; 423 lush RB on Bedtime Stories 1994; 424 operatic show tunes on Evita 1996; 425 guitar-driven folk music on American Life 2003; 426 as well as multilingual world music on Madame X 2019. 427 Voice and instruments Madonna playing the guitar riff of A New Level by heavy metal band Pantera during the 2008 Sticky Sweet Tour 428 Possessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range 429 430 Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice. 431 Mark Bego author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition called her the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs despite not being a heavyweight talent . 432 According to Tony Sclafani from MSNBC Madonnas vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs straight but Madonna employs subtext irony aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did. 415 Madonna used a bright girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passe in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labeled her as Minnie Mouse on helium . 431 During the filming of Evita 1996 Madonna had to take vocal lessons which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasnt using. Before I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it. 412 Besides singing Madonna has the ability to play several musical instruments. Piano was the first instrument taught to her as a child. 27 In the late 1970s she learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy before joining the Breakfast Club lineup as the drummer. 433 She later played guitar with the band Emmy as well as on her own demo recordings . 434 After her career breakthrough Madonna was absent performing with guitar for years but she is credited for playing cowbell on Madonna 1983 and synthesizer on Like a Prayer 1989. 397 In 1999 Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart but she eventually left the project before filming began. 435 Madonna decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of Music 2000 and recruited guitarist Monte Pittman to help improve her skill. 436 Since then Madonna has played guitar on every tour as well as her studio albums. 397 She received a nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award at the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards . 437 Music videos and performances See also: Madonna videography In The Madonna Companion biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work more than any other recent pop artist. 438 According to them many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in his book Nots 1993 felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is the video and the reigning queen of video is Madonna. He further asserted that the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonnas excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory. 439 The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as Papa Dont Preach Like a Prayer or Justify My Love had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact rather than the songs themselves. 438 Morton felt that artistically Madonnas songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos. 440 In 2003 MTV named her The Greatest Music Video Star Ever and said that Madonnas innovation creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award. 441 442 In 2020 Billboard ranked her atop the 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time. 443 Madonnas live performances vary from choreographed routines such as voguing above to stripped-down ones with only a ukulele below . Madonnas initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamour. 438 She was able to transmit her avant-garde Downtown Manhattan fashion sense to the American audience. 444 The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the True Blue era. 445 Author Douglas Kellner noted such multiculturalism and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences. 446 Madonnas Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time in the form of boleros and layered skirts accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of La Isla Bonita . 447 448 Academics noted that with her videos Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex. 449 This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for Like a Prayer . The video included scenes of an African-American church choir Madonna being attracted to a black saint statue and singing in front of burning crosses. 450 Madonnas acting performances in films have frequently received poor reviews from film critics. Stephanie Zacharek stated in Time that Madonna seems wooden and unnatural as an actress and its tough to watch because shes clearly trying her damnedest. According to biographer Andrew Morton Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism but privately she is deeply hurt. 451 After the critically panned box-office bomb Swept Away 2002 Madonna vowed never to act again in a film. 452 While reviewing her career retrospective titled Body of Work 2016 at New Yorks Metrograph hall The Guardian s Nigel M. Smith wrote that Madonnas film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to her and she otherwise could steal a scene for all the right reasons . 453 Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned her live performances are critical successes. 454 Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactments of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally the fact that images from Madonnas videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the original videos realism. She believed that her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized . 455 Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia latest technology and sound systems Madonnas concerts and live performances are extravagant show pieces and walking art shows. 456 Chris Nelson from The New York Times commented that artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing. 457 Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour she has subsequently reorganized her performances by staying mostly still during her toughest singing parts and leaves the dance routines to her backup troupe ... rather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time. 458 To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage the microphone design came to be known as the Madonna mic . 459 460 Legacy Main article: Cultural impact of Madonna Shes a major historical figure and when she passes the retrospectives will loom larger and larger in history. Academic Camille Paglia on Madonna 2017. 461 Madonna has built a legacy that transcends music and has been studied by sociologists historians and other scholars contributing to the rise of Madonna studies a subfield of American cultural studies . 462 463 464 According to Rodrigo Fresan saying that Madonna is just a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that Coca-Cola is just a soda . Madonna is one of the classic symbols of Made in USA . 465 Rolling Stone Spain wrote She became the first master of viral pop in history years before the internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels radio formulas magazine covers and even in bookstores. A pop dialectic never seen since the Beatles s reign which allowed her to keep on the edge of trend and commerciality. 466 William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that Madonna has changed the worlds social history has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to. 467 Professor Diane Pecknold noted that nearly any poll of the biggest greatest or best in popular culture includes Madonnas name . 464 In 2012 VH1 ranked Madonna as the greatest woman in music . 468 Wax figure of Madonna at Madame Tussauds museum in Hong Kong Spin writer Bianca Gracie stated that the Queen of Pop isnt enough to describe Madonnashe is Pop. She formulated the blueprint of what a pop star should be. 469 According to Sclafani Its worth noting that before Madonna most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after her almost all would be female singers ... When the Beatles hit America they changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it backwith an emphasis on the female. 470 Howard Kramer curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame asserted that Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow ... She certainly raised the standards of all of them ... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers. 471 Andy Bennett and Steve Waksman authors of The SAGE Handbook of Popular Music 2014 noted that almost all female pop stars of recent years Britney Spears Beyonce Rihanna Katy Perry Lady Gaga and othersacknowledge the important influence of Madonna on their own careers. 413 Madonna has also influenced male artists inspiring rock frontmen Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park to become musicians. 472 473 Madonnas use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism . 474 The Times wrote that she had started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex nudity style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice. 475 Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self of sexuality and of ones social relations. 476 In Doing Gender in Media Art and Culture 2009 the authors noted that Madonna as a female celebrity performer and pop icon can unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. 477 According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys Madonna represents womans occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex as powerful and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvee allotted to women. 478 Professor Sut Jhally has referred to her as an almost sacred feminist icon . 479 Writing for The Guardian Matt Cain stated that Madonna has broken down social barriers and brought marginalized groups to the forefront by frequently featuring LGBT Latino and black culture in her works. 480 An author said that by making culture generally available Madonna becomes the culture of all social classes . 481 Canadian professor Karlene Faith gave her point of view saying that Madonnas peculiarity is that she has cruised so freely through so many cultural terrains and she has been a cult figure within self-propelling subcultures just as she became a major. 482 GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis stated that Madonna always has and always will be the LGBTQ communitys greatest ally 483 while The Advocate dubbed her as the greatest gay icon . 484 Madonna herself stated in 2024 Aside from my birthday New York Pride is the most important day of the year. 485 Madonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry and generating over 1.2 billion in sales within the first decade of her career. 486 According to Gini Gorlinski in the book The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time 2010 Madonnas levels of power and control were unprecedented for a woman in the entertainment industry. 487 London Business School academics called her a dynamic entrepreneur worth copying; they identified her vision of success her understanding of the music industry her ability to recognize her own performance limits and thus bring in help her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. 488 Morton wrote that Madonna is opportunistic manipulative and ruthlesssomebody who wont stop until she gets what she wantsand thats something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But that hardly mattered to her. 489 Awards and achievements Main articles: List of awards and nominations received by Madonna and List of Madonna records and achievements Madonna was the first person to be inducted into the Wembley Square of Fame in London England. 490 Madonnas net worth is estimated between 800 million and 850 million 491 492 which makes her one of the wealthiest musical artists . Forbes has named her the annual top-earning female musician 11 times across the 1980s 493 1990s 494 2000s 495 and 2010s. 282 She has sold over 300 million records worldwide. 496 497 The Guinness World Records acknowledged her as the bestselling female music artist of all time. 498 According to the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA she is the bestselling female rock artist of the 20th century and the third highest-certified female albums artist in the United States with 65.5 million certified album units. 499 500 She is tied with Barbra Streisand for the most RIAA multi-platinum albums by a female artist. 501 Madonna had generated over US1.5 billion from ticket sales of her concert tours throughout her career 502 becoming the first woman to accumulate US1 billion in concert revenue. 503 Madonna was the highest-grossing female touring artist 504 before being overtaken by Taylor Swift and Beyonce in 2023 according to Pollstar . Madonna also remains one of the selected artists to have two solo concerts with 100 000 sold tickets ; her Whos That Girl World Tour s concert in Parc de Sceaux Paris drew over 130 000 audience while her Girlie Show s concert in Maracana Stadium Rio de Janeiro drew over 120 000 audience. 89 505 The closing performance of The Celebration Tour in Copacabana Rio de Janeiro on May 5 2024 drew over 1 6 million people becoming the largest audience for a stand-alone concert by any artist . 360 She has also won seven Grammy Awards and twenty MTV Video Music Awards including the 1986 Video Vanguard Award for which she became the first female recipient. 506 507 According to Billboard Madonna is the most successful solo artist in the Hot 100 chart history second overall behind the Beatles and the most successful dance club artist of all time. 508 509 With a total of 50 Dance Club Songs chart-toppers Madonna became the artist with the most number ones on any singular Billboard chart pulling ahead of George Strait with 44 number-one songs on the Hot Country Songs chart. 318 She has also scored 38 top-ten singles on the Hot 100; she held the record among all artists for nearly two decades between 2002 and 2020 before being overtaken by Drake and by Taylor Swift in 2022 among females. 510 511 512 Internationally Madonna holds the record for the most number-one singles by a female artist in Canada 24 c Italy 23 d Finland 7 517 Spain 21 518 519 and the United Kingdom 13. 520 At the 40th anniversary of the GfK Media Control Charts Madonna was ranked as the most successful singles artist in German chart history. 521 Discography Main articles: Madonna albums discography Madonna singles discography and List of songs recorded by Madonna Madonna 1983 Like a Virgin 1984 True Blue 1986 Like a Prayer 1989 Erotica 1992 Bedtime Stories 1994 Ray of Light 1998 Music 2000 American Life 2003 Confessions on a Dance Floor 2005 Hard Candy 2008 MDNA 2012 Rebel Heart 2015 Madame X 2019 Filmography Main article: Madonna filmography Films starred Desperately Seeking Susan 1985 A Certain Sacrifice 1985 Shanghai Surprise 1986 Whos That Girl 1987 Bloodhounds of Broadway 1989 Dick Tracy 1990 Madonna: Truth or Dare 1991 A League of Their Own 1992 Body of Evidence 1993 Dangerous Game 1993 Four Rooms 1995 Girl 6 1996 Evita 1996 The Next Best Thing 2000 Swept Away 2002 Im Going to Tell You a Secret 2005 Arthur and the Invisibles 2006 Madame X 2021 Films directed Filth and Wisdom 2008 W.E. 2011 Tours Main article: List of Madonna concerts The Virgin Tour 1985 Whos That Girl World Tour 1987 Blond Ambition World Tour 1990 The Girlie Show 1993 Drowned World Tour 2001 Re-Invention World Tour 2004 Confessions Tour 2006 Sticky Sweet Tour 20082009 The MDNA Tour 2012 Rebel Heart Tour 20152016 Madame X Tour 20192020 The Celebration Tour 20232024 Enterprises Main article: Madonna and business See also: Madonna fashion brands Maverick 19922004 Ray of Light Foundation 1998 Raising Malawi 2006 Hard Candy Fitness 20102019 Truth or Dare by Madonna 20112018 See also Biography portal Pop music portal United States portal List of dancers List of most expensive divorces List of largest music deals List of organisms named after famous people born 1950present List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees LGBT culture in New York City NYC Pride March Philanthropy and activism of Madonna Notes Madonna goes by her first name and has used the name and trademark since 1979 according to the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO. 1 Attributed to multiple references: 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 Madonna has more number-one singles than any other act in Canadian music history with 18 singles during the RPM era 2 singles during the Canadian Hot 100 era and 4 singles between 2000 and 2007 on the Canadian Singles Chart . 513 514 Madonna has more number-one singles than any other female artist in Italian music history with 11 singles during the Musica e dischi era and 12 during the FIMI era. 515 516 References Geneva October 16 2000.
