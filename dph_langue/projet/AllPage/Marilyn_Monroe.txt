Known for playing comic blonde bombshell characters she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s as well as an emblem of the eras sexual revolution . She was a top-billed actress for a decade and her films grossed 200 million equivalent to 2 billion in 2023 by the time of her death in 1962. 1 Born and raised in Los Angeles County Monroe spent most of her childhood in a total of twelve foster homes and an orphanage before marrying James Dougherty at age sixteen. She was working in a factory during World War II when she met a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career which led to short-lived film contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures . After a series of minor film roles she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next two years she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business and in the dramas Clash by Night and Dont Bother to Knock . Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photographs prior to becoming a star but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her films. By 1953 Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars. She had leading roles in the film noir Niagara which overtly relied on her sex appeal and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire which established her star image as a dumb blonde . The same year her nude images were used as the centerfold and cover of the first issue of Playboy . Monroe played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career but felt disappointed when typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but returned to star in The Seven Year Itch 1955 one of the biggest box office successes of her career. When the studio was still reluctant to change Monroes contract she founded her own film production company in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to building the company and began studying method acting under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio . Later that year Fox awarded her a new contract which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop 1956 and her first independent production in The Prince and the Showgirl 1957. She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role in Some Like It Hot 1959 a critical and commercial success. Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits 1961. Monroes troubled private life received much attention. Her marriages to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and to playwright Arthur Miller were highly publicized; both ended in divorce. On August 4 1962 she died at age 36 of an overdose of barbiturates at her Los Angeles home . Her death was ruled a probable suicide. Long after her death Monroe remains a pop culture icon 2 with the American Film Institute ranking her as the sixth-greatest female screen legend from the Golden Age of Hollywood . 3 Life and career 19261943: Childhood and first marriage Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson a at Los Angeles General Hospital on June 1 1926. 6 Her mother Gladys Pearl Baker nee Monroe was born in Piedras Negras Coahuila Mexico 7 to a poor Midwestern family who migrated to California at the turn of the century. 8 At age 15 Gladys had married John Newton Baker an abusive man nine years her senior. They had two children together Robert 9 and Berniece . 10 She successfully filed for divorce and sole custody of her two oldest in 1923 but Baker kidnapped the children soon after and moved with them to his native Kentucky . 11 Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was 12 12 and they met for the first time in 1944 when Monroe was 17 or 18. 13 Following the divorce Gladys worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries . 14 Her second marriage occurred in 1924 when she married Martin Edward Mortensen but they separated just months later and divorced in 1928. 14 b In 2022 DNA testing indicated that Monroes father was Charles Stanley Gifford 19 20 21 a co-worker of Gladys with whom she had an affair in 1925 18 though until then her father was thought to be Mortensen. 22 Monroe had two other half-siblings from Giffords marriage with his first wife; a sister Doris Elizabeth and a brother Charles Stanley. 23 Monroe as an infant c. 1927 Although Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child Monroes early childhood was stable and happy. 24 Gladys placed her daughter with evangelical Christian foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the suburban town of Hawthorne . She also lived there for six months until she was forced to move back to the city for employment. 25 She then began visiting her daughter on weekends. 24 In the summer of 1933 Gladys bought a small house in Hollywood with a loan from the Home Owners Loan Corporation and moved seven-year-old Monroe in with her. 26 They shared the house with lodgers actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter Nellie. 27 In January 1934 Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia . 28 After several months in a rest home she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital . 29 She spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals and was rarely in contact with Monroe. 30 Monroe became a ward of the state and her mothers friend Grace Goddard took responsibility over her and her mothers affairs. 31 For the next 16 months Monroe continued living with the Atkinsons and may have been sexually abused during this time. 32 c Always a shy girl she developed a stutter and became withdrawn. 38 In the summer of 1935 she briefly stayed with Grace and her husband Erwin Doc Goddard and two other families. 39 In September 1935 Grace placed her in the Los Angeles Orphans Home 2 Hollygrove. 40 41 42 43 The orphanage was a model institution and was described in positive terms by her peers but Monroe felt abandoned. 44 Encouraged by the orphanage staff who thought that Monroe would be happier living in a family Grace became her legal guardian in 1936 but did not take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. 45 Monroes second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months because Doc allegedly molested her though these claims are disputed 46 47 . She then lived for brief periods with her relatives and Graces friends and relatives in Los Angeles and Compton . 48 Monroe with her first husband James Dougherty c. 194344 . They married when she was 16 and divorced in 1946 when she was 20. Monroes childhood experiences first made her want to become an actress: I didnt like the world around me because it was kind of grim ... When I heard that this was acting I said thats what I want to be ... Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there Id sit all day and way into the night. Up in front there with the screen so big a little kid all alone and I loved it. 49 Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938 when she began living with Graces aunt Ana Lower in Sawtelle . 50 Monroe was enrolled at Emerson Junior High School and went to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. 51 She excelled in writing and contributed to the school newspaper but was otherwise a mediocre student. 52 Owing to the elderly Lowers health problems Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in about early 1941. 53 54 That same year she began attending Van Nuys High School where she met factory worker James Dougherty five years her senior. 55 At the age of 15 she began dating him. 56 57 58 59 Monroe had been harboring a crush on Dougherty who had been class president and football captain during his days at school. 58 In 1942 the company that employed Doc Goddard relocated him to West Virginia . 60 California child protection laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state and she faced having to return to the orphanage. 61 To prevent this Grace Goddard approached Doughertys mother Ethel with the proposition that Dougherty marry Monroe. 62 Ethel agreed and the two told Monroe and Dougherty their idea. Both were rather skeptical: Dougherty thought Monroe was rather young to marry and Monroe was nervous. 63 On one occasion Monroe approached Grace with the idea that they marry as friends instead of consummating their marriage but Grace replied Dont worry youll learn. 58 Monroe married Dougherty on June 19 1942 just after her 16th birthday at the home of family friends named the Howells. 64 63 Though neither the Goddards or Monroes mother attended the wedding Bolenders and their daughter Nancy were in attendance. I remember the winding staircase in the living room and all of us just staring at the top of the stairs until she appeared Nancy later recalled. What a beautiful bride. 58 Monroe subsequently dropped out of high school and became a housewife. 63 After the wedding they honeymooned at a lake in Ventura County California then moved into a studio apartment in Sherman Oaks Los Angeles where they lived a calm idyllic life. 62 65 Dougherty later recalled that despite the circumstances they married under he and Monroe loved each other madly and that being married was like being on a honeymoon for a year. 65 However according to biographer Donald Spoto Monroe found herself and Dougherty mismatched and later said she was dying of boredom during the marriage. 66 The first problems in their marriage appeared in late 1943 when Monroe and Dougherty attended a dance at the Catalina Casino ballroom. That night Monroe was a popular dancing partner while Dougherty was relatively ignored. Jealous he told her that they were leaving. When Monroe told him she might go back to the dance alone he told her that she would not be allowed to come home if she did. 59 In 1943 Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine and was stationed on Santa Catalina Island where Monroe moved with him. 67 19441948: Modeling divorce and first film roles A photo of Monroe taken by David Conover in June 1945 at the Radioplane Company In April 1944 Dougherty was shipped out to the Pacific where he remained for most of the next two years. 67 Monroe who had previously been having doubts about having children begged him for a baby before he left. 63 That same year Monroe met Miracle and her husband Paris for the first time. They continued to stay in touch throughout Monroes career. 68 After Dougherty left Monroe moved in with Doughertys parents and began a job at the Radioplane Company a munitions factory in Van Nuys to help the war effort. 67 In late 1944 she met photographer David Conover who had been sent by captain Ronald Reagan 69 then working in the U.S. Army Air Forces First Motion Picture Unit to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers. 70 Although none of her pictures were used she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends. 71 72 Defying her deployed husband and his disapproving mother she moved on her own and signed a contract with the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945. 73 63 The agency deemed Monroes figure more suitable for pin-up than high fashion modeling and she was featured mostly in advertisements and mens magazines. 74 She straightened her naturally curly brown hair and dyed it platinum blonde on advice from a modeling agency . 75 76 According to Emmeline Snively the agencys owner Monroe quickly became one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946 she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant U.S. Camera Laff and Peek . 77 As a model Monroe occasionally used the pseudonym Jean Norman. 75 Monroe posing as a pin-up model for a postcard photograph c. 1940s Through Snively Monroe signed a contract with an acting agency in June 1946. 78 After an unsuccessful interview at Paramount Pictures she was given a screen-test by Ben Lyon a 20th Century-Fox executive. Head executive Darryl F. Zanuck was unenthusiastic about it 79 but he gave her a standard six-month contract to avoid her being signed by rival studio RKO Pictures . d Monroes contract began in August 1946 and she and Lyon selected the stage name Marilyn Monroe . 81 The first name was picked by Lyon who was reminded of Broadway star Marilyn Miller ; the surname was Monroes mothers maiden name. 82 However the studio was reluctant to hire Monroe a married woman for fear she would become pregnant. 83 84 In September 1946 she traveled to Las Vegas to divorce Dougherty leaving him heartbroken. 85 86 Though Monroe wanted to continue the relationship unmarried Dougherty refused. 86 Monroe spent her first six months at Fox learning acting singing and dancing and observing the film-making process. 87 Her contract was renewed in February 1947 and she was given her first film roles bit parts in Dangerous Years 1947 and Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! 1948. 88 e The studio also enrolled her in the Actors Laboratory Theatre an acting school teaching the techniques of the Group Theatre ; she later stated that it was my first taste of what real acting in a real drama could be and I was hooked . 90 Despite her enthusiasm her teachers thought her too shy and insecure to have a future in acting and Fox did not renew her contract in August 1947. 91 She returned to modeling while also doing occasional odd jobs at film studios such as working as a dancing pacer behind the scenes to keep the leads on point at musical sets. 91 Monroe in a 1948 publicity photo Monroe was determined to make it as an actress and continued studying at the Actors Lab. She had a small role in the play Glamour Preferred at the Bliss-Hayden Theater but it ended after a couple of performances. 92 To network she frequented producers offices befriended gossip columnist Sidney Skolsky and entertained influential male guests at studio functions a practice she had begun at Fox. 93 She also became a friend and occasional sex partner of Fox executive Joseph M. Schenck who persuaded his friend Harry Cohn the head executive of Columbia Pictures to sign her in March 1948. 94 At Columbia Monroes look was modeled after Rita Hayworth and her hair was bleached platinum blonde. 95 She began working with the studios head drama coach Natasha Lytess who would remain her mentor until 1955. 96 Her only film at the studio was the low-budget musical Ladies of the Chorus 1948 in which she had her first starring role as a chorus girl courted by a wealthy man. 89 She also screen-tested for the lead role in Born Yesterday 1950 but her contract was not renewed in September 1948. 97 Ladies of the Chorus was released the following month and was not a success. 98 19491952: Breakthrough years Monroe in The Asphalt Jungle 1950 one of her earliest performances to gain attention from film critics When her contract at Columbia ended Monroe returned again to modeling. She shot a commercial for Pabst beer and posed for artistic nude photographs by Tom Kelley for John Baumgarth 99 calendars using the name Mona Monroe. 100 Monroe had previously posed topless or clad in a bikini for other artists including Earl Moran and felt comfortable with nudity. 101 f Shortly after leaving Columbia she also met and became the protegee and mistress of Johnny Hyde the vice president of the William Morris Agency . 102 Through Hyde Monroe landed small roles in several films g including two critically acclaimed works: Joseph Mankiewicz s drama All About Eve 1950 and John Huston s film noir The Asphalt Jungle 1950. 103 Despite her screen time being only a few minutes in the latter she gained a mention in Photoplay and according to biographer Donald Spoto moved effectively from movie model to serious actress . 104 In December 1950 Hyde negotiated a seven-year contract for Monroe with 20th Century-Fox. 105 According to its terms Fox could opt not to renew the contract after each year. 106 Hyde died of a heart attack only days later which left Monroe devastated. 107 In 1951 Monroe had supporting roles in three moderately successful Fox comedies: As Young as You Feel Love Nest and Lets Make It Legal . 108 According to Spoto all three films featured her essentially as a sexy ornament but she received some praise from critics: Bosley Crowther of The New York Times described her as superb in As Young As You Feel and Ezra Goodman of the Los Angeles Daily News called her one of the brightest up-and-coming actresses for Love Nest . 109 Her popularity with audiences was also growing: she received several thousand fan letters a week and was declared Miss Cheesecake of 1951 by the army newspaper Stars and Stripes reflecting the preferences of soldiers in the Korean War . 110 In February 1952 the Hollywood Foreign Press Association named Monroe the best young box office personality . 111 In her private life Monroe had a short relationship with director Elia Kazan and also briefly dated several other men including director Nicholas Ray and actors Yul Brynner and Peter Lawford . 112 In early 1952 she began a highly publicized romance with retired New York Yankees baseball star Joe DiMaggio one of the most famous sports personalities of the era. 113 Monroe with Keith Andes in Clash by Night 1952. The film allowed Monroe to display more of her acting range in a dramatic role Monroe found herself at the center of a scandal in March 1952 when she revealed publicly that she had posed for a nude calendar in 1949. 114 The studio had learned about the photos and that she was publicly rumored to be the model some weeks prior and together with Monroe decided that to prevent damaging her career it was best to admit to them while stressing that she had been broke at the time. 115 The strategy gained her public sympathy and increased interest in her films for which she was now receiving top billing . In the wake of the scandal Monroe was featured on the cover of Life magazine as the Talk of Hollywood and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper declared her the cheesecake queen turned box office smash . 116 Three of Monroes films Clash by Night Dont Bother to Knock and Were Not Married! were released soon after to capitalize on the public interest. 117 Despite her newfound popularity as a sex symbol Monroe also wished to showcase more of her acting range. She had begun taking acting classes with Michael Chekhov and mime Lotte Goslar soon after beginning the Fox contract 118 and Clash by Night and Dont Bother to Knock showed her in different roles. 119 In the former a drama starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Fritz Lang she played a fish cannery worker; to prepare she spent time in a fish cannery in Monterey . 120 She received positive reviews for her performance: The Hollywood Reporter stated that she deserves starring status with her excellent interpretation and Variety wrote that she has an ease of delivery which makes her a cinch for popularity . 121 122 The latter was a thriller in which Monroe starred as a mentally disturbed babysitter and which Zanuck used to test her abilities in a heavier dramatic role. 123 It received mixed reviews from critics with Crowther deeming her too inexperienced for the difficult role 124 and Variety blaming the script for the films problems. 125 126 Monroe in Dont Bother to Knock 1952 Monroes three other films in 1952 continued with her typecasting in comedic roles that highlighted her sex appeal. In Were Not Married! her role as a beauty pageant contestant was created solely to present Marilyn in two bathing suits according to its writer Nunnally Johnson . 127 In Howard Hawks s Monkey Business in which she acted opposite Cary Grant she played a secretary who is a dumb childish blonde innocently unaware of the havoc her sexiness causes around her . 128 In O. Henrys Full House with Charles Laughton she appeared in a passing vignette as a nineteenth-century street walker. 129 Monroe added to her reputation as a new sex symbol with publicity stunts that year: she wore a revealing dress when acting as Grand Marshal at the Miss America Pageant parade and told gossip columnist Earl Wilson that she usually wore no underwear. 130 By the end of the year gossip columnist Florabel Muir named Monroe the it girl of 1952. 131 132 During this period Monroe gained a reputation for being difficult to work with which would worsen as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all did not remember her lines and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. 133 Her dependence on her acting coachesNatasha Lytess and then Paula Strasberg also irritated directors. 134 Monroes problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism low self-esteem and stage fright. 135 She disliked her lack of control on film sets and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. 135 136 To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia she began to use barbiturates amphetamines and alcohol which also exacerbated her problems although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. 137 According to Sarah Churchwell some of Monroes behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. 138 Biographer Lois Banner said that she was bullied by many of her directors. 139 1953: Rising star Monroe in Niagara 1953 which dwelt on her sex appeal Monroe starred in three movies that were released in 1953 and emerged as a major sex symbol and one of Hollywoods most bankable performers. 140 141 The first was the Technicolor film noir Niagara in which she played a femme fatale scheming to murder her husband played by Joseph Cotten . 142 By then Monroe and her make-up artist Allan Whitey Snyder had developed her trademark make-up look: dark arched brows pale skin glistening red lips and a beauty mark . 143 According to Sarah Churchwell Niagara was one of the most overtly sexual films of Monroes career. 128 In some scenes Monroes body was covered only by a sheet or a towel considered shocking by contemporary audiences. 144 Niagara s most famous scene is a 30-second long shot behind Monroe where she is seen walking with her hips swaying which was used heavily in the films marketing. 144 Monroe performing the song Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend in the trailer for the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes When Niagara was released in January 1953 womens clubs protested it as immoral but it proved popular with audiences. 145 While Variety deemed it cliched and morbid The New York Times commented that the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see as although Monroe may not be the perfect actress at this point ... she can be seductiveeven when she walks . 146 147 Monroe continued to attract attention by wearing revealing outfits most famously at the Photoplay Awards in January 1953 where she won the Fastest Rising Star award. 148 A pleated sunburst waist-tight deep decollete gold lame dress designed by William Travilla for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes but barely seen at all in the film was to become a sensation. 149 Prompted by such imagery veteran star Joan Crawford publicly called the behavior unbecoming an actress and a lady . 148 While Niagara made Monroe a sex symbol and established her look her second film of 1953 the satirical musical comedy Gentlemen Prefer Blondes cemented her screen persona as a dumb blonde . 150 Based on Anita Loos novel and its Broadway version the film focuses on two gold-digging showgirls played by Monroe and Jane Russell . Monroes role was originally intended for Betty Grable who had been 20th Century-Foxs most popular blonde bombshell in the 1940s; Monroe was fast eclipsing her as a star who could appeal to both male and female audiences. 151 As part of the films publicity campaign she and Russell pressed their hand and footprints in wet concrete outside Graumans Chinese Theatre in June. 152 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was released shortly after and became one of the biggest box office successes of the year. 153 Crowther of The New York Times and William Brogdon of Variety both commented favorably on Monroe especially noting her performance of Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend ; according to the latter she demonstrated the ability to sex a song as well as point up the eye values of a scene by her presence . 154 155 Monroe with Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall in the film How to Marry a Millionaire 1953 In September Monroe made her television debut in the Jack Benny Show playing Jacks fantasy woman in the episode Honolulu Trip . 156 She co-starred with Grable and Lauren Bacall in her third movie of the year How to Marry a Millionaire released in November. It featured Monroe as a naive model who teams up with her friends to find rich husbands repeating the successful formula of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes . It was the second film ever released in CinemaScope a widescreen format that Fox hoped would draw audiences back to theaters as television was beginning to cause losses to film studios. 157 Despite mixed reviews the film was Monroes biggest box office success at that point in her career. 158 Unlike on the sets of other films Monroe got along well with her costars particularly Grable who reportedly found Monroe a delightful person to hang out with. 159 Monroe was listed in the annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in both 1953 and 1954 141 and according to Fox historian Aubrey Solomon became the studios greatest asset alongside CinemaScope. 160 Monroes position as a leading sex symbol was confirmed in December 1953 when Hugh Hefner featured her on the cover and as centerfold in the first issue of Playboy ; Monroe did not consent to the publication. 161 The cover image was a photograph taken of her at the Miss America Pageant parade in 1952 and the centerfold featured one of her 1949 nude photographs. 161 19541955: Conflicts with 20th Century-Fox and marriage to Joe DiMaggio Monroe had become one of 20th Century-Foxs biggest stars but her contract had not changed since 1950 so that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects. 162 Her attempts to appear in films that would not focus on her as a pin-up had been thwarted by the studio head executive Darryl F. Zanuck who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in other types of roles. 163 Under pressure from the studios owner Spyros Skouras Zanuck had also decided that Fox should focus exclusively on entertainment to maximize profits and canceled the production of any serious films . 164 In January 1954 he suspended Monroe when she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy The Girl in Pink Tights . 165 This was front-page news and Monroe immediately took action to counter negative publicity. At the 11th Golden Globe Awards in 1954 Monroe was named World Film Favorite despite not being present at the awards ceremony. 166 Monroe and Joe DiMaggio shortly after their wedding January 1954 Monroe met baseball player Joe DiMaggio in 1952 while on a blind date in Los Angeles. 167 After two years of dating 168 she and DiMaggio were married at the San Francisco City Hall on January 14 1954. 169 They spent their honeymoon 170 outside Idyllwild California 171 172 173 in the mountain lodge of Monroes lawyer Lloyd Wright. 174 175 On January 29 1954 fifteen days later 176 they flew to Japan 177 combining a honeymoon with his commitment to his former San Francisco Seals coach Lefty ODoul 178 to help train 179 Japanese baseball teams. 180 181 From Tokyo she traveled with Jean ODoul 180 Leftys wife to Korea 182 183 where she participated in a USO show 184 singing for over 60 000 U.S. Marines over a four-day period. 185 186 187 After returning to the U.S. she was awarded Photoplay s Most Popular Female Star prize. 188 Monroe settled with Fox in March with the promise of a new contract a bonus of 100 000 and a starring role in the film adaptation of the Broadway success The Seven Year Itch . 189 In April 1954 Otto Preminger s western River of No Return the last film that Monroe had filmed prior to the suspension was released. She called it a Z-grade cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process but it was popular with audiences. 190 The first film she made after the suspension was the musical Theres No Business Like Show Business which she strongly disliked but the studio required her to do for dropping The Girl in Pink Tights . 189 It was unsuccessful upon its release in late 1954 with Monroes performance considered vulgar by many critics. 191 Monroe posing for photographers in The Seven Year Itch 1955 In September 1954 Monroe began filming Billy Wilder s comedy The Seven Year Itch starring opposite Tom Ewell as a woman who becomes the object of her married neighbors sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene in which Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. 192 The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted nearly 2 000 spectators. 192 The subway grate scene became one of Monroes most famous and The Seven Year Itch became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year after its release in June 1955. 193 However the scene infuriated DiMaggio who reportedly physically abused Monroe in their hotel room while she screamed for help. 86 194 The publicity stunt placed Monroe on international front pages and it also marked the end of her marriage to DiMaggio. 195 The union had been troubled from the start by his jealousy and controlling attitude; he was also physically abusive. 196 After returning from NYC to Hollywood in October 1954 Monroe filed for divorce after only nine months of marriage. 197 DiMaggio was devastated and wrote letters to Monroe apologizing and confessing his undying love for her. 167 Monroe was also incredibly sad and could be seen crying in court during the divorce procedures. 168 After filming for The Seven Year Itch wrapped up in November 1954 Monroe left Hollywood for the East Coast where she and photographer Milton Greene founded their own production company Marilyn Monroe Productions MMPan action that has later been called instrumental in the collapse of the studio system . 198 h Monroe stated that she was tired of the same old sex roles and asserted that she was no longer under contract to Fox as it had not fulfilled its duties such as paying her the promised bonus. 200 This began a year-long legal battle between her and Fox in January 1955. 201 The press largely ridiculed Monroe and she was parodied in the Broadway play Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? 1955 in which her lookalike Jayne Mansfield played a dumb actress who starts her own production company. 202 Monroe at the Actors Studio c. 1955 After founding MMP Monroe moved to Manhattan and spent 1955 studying acting. She took classes with Constance Collier and attended workshops on method acting at the Actors Studio run by Lee Strasberg . 203 She grew close to Strasberg and his wife Paula receiving private lessons at their home due to her shyness and soon became a family member. 204 She replaced her old acting coach Natasha Lytess with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence for the rest of her career. 205 Monroe also started undergoing psychoanalysis as Strasberg believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use them in their performances. 206 i Monroe continued her relationship with DiMaggio despite the ongoing divorce process; she was also rumored to have dated actor Marlon Brando . 208 209 Monroe had met playwright Arthur Miller in 1951 after being introduced on the set of As Young as You Feel by director Elia Kazan . 208 Though he was married to Mary Slattery they began an affair in 1955. 210 The affair became increasingly serious after October 1955 when Monroes divorce was finalized and Miler separated from Slattery so he could be with Monroe. 211 212 The studio urged her to end it as Miller was being investigated by the FBI for allegations of communism and had been subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee but Monroe refused. 213 The relationship led to the FBI opening a file on her as they suspected she was part of a communist group. 211 However the FBI never uncovered any evidence proving these claims. 214 By the end of the year Monroe and Fox signed a new seven-year contract as MMP would not be able to finance films alone and the studio was eager to have Monroe working for them again. 201 Fox would pay her 400 000 to make four films and granted her the right to choose her own projects directors and cinematographers. 215 She would also be free to make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox. 215 19561959: Critical acclaim and marriage to Arthur Miller Monroes dramatic performance in Bus Stop 1956 marked a departure from her earlier comedies. Monroe began 1956 by announcing her win over 20th Century-Fox. 216 On February 23 1956 she legally changed her name to Marilyn Monroe . 217 The press wrote favorably about her decision to fight the studio; Time called her a shrewd businesswoman 218 and Look predicted that the win would be an example of the individual against the herd for years to come . 216 In contrast Monroes relationship with Miller prompted some negative comments such as Walter Winchell s statement that Americas best-known blonde moving picture star is now the darling of the left-wing intelligentsia. 219 In March Monroe began filming the drama Bus Stop her first film under the new contract. 220 She played Cherie a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a naive cowboy who falls in love with her. For the role she learned an Ozark accent chose costumes and makeup that lacked the glamor of her earlier films and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing. 221 Broadway director Joshua Logan agreed to direct despite initially doubting Monroes acting abilities and knowing of her difficult reputation. 222 The filming took place in Idaho and Arizona with Monroe technically in charge as the head of MMP occasionally making decisions on cinematography and with Logan adapting to her chronic lateness and perfectionism. 223 The experience changed Logans opinion of Monroe and he later compared her to Charlie Chaplin in her ability to blend comedy and tragedy. 224 Monroe and Arthur Miller at their wedding June 1956 On June 29 1956 Monroe and Miller were married in a four-minute civil ceremony at the Westchester County Court in White Plains New York ; two days later they had a Jewish ceremony at the home of Kay Brown Millers literary agent in Waccabuc New York . 225 57 210 With the marriage Monroe converted to Judaism which led Egypt to ban all of her films. 226 j Due to Monroes status as a sex symbol and Millers image as an intellectual the media saw the union as a mismatch as evidenced by Variety s headline Egghead Weds Hourglass . 228 That year Monroe became pregnant but miscarried. 229 Bus Stop was released in August 1956 and became a critical and commercial success. 230 The Saturday Review of Literature wrote that Monroes performance effectively dispels once and for all the notion that she is merely a glamour personality and Crowther proclaimed: Hold on to your chairs everybody and get set for a rattling surprise. Marilyn Monroe has finally proved herself an actress. 231 She also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role - Musical or Comedy for her performance. 111 In August Monroe also began filming MMPs first independent production The Prince and the Showgirl at Pinewood Studios in England. 232 Based on a 1953 stage play by Terence Rattigan it was to be directed and co-produced by and to co-star Laurence Olivier . 218 The production was complicated by conflicts between him and Monroe. 233 Olivier who had also directed and starred in the stage play angered her with the patronizing statement All you have to do is be sexy and with his demand she replicate Vivien Leigh s stage interpretation of the character. 234 He also disliked the constant presence of Paula Strasberg Monroes acting coach on set. 235 In retaliation Monroe became uncooperative and began to deliberately arrive late later saying if you dont respect your artists they cant work well. 233 Monroe with Laurence Olivier in a publicity photo for The Prince and the Showgirl 1957 Monroe also experienced other problems during the production. Her dependence on pharmaceuticals escalated and according to Spoto she had a miscarriage. 236 She and Greene also argued over how MMP should be run. 236 Despite the difficulties filming was completed on schedule by the end of 1956. 237 The Prince and the Showgirl was released to mixed reviews in June 1957 and proved unpopular with American audiences. 238 It was better received in Europe where she was awarded the Italian David di Donatello and the French Crystal Star awards and nominated for a BAFTA . 239 After returning from England Monroe took an 18-month hiatus to concentrate on family life. She and Miller split their time between NYC Connecticut and Long Island . 240 She had an ectopic pregnancy in mid-1957 and a miscarriage a year later; 241 these problems were most likely linked to her endometriosis . 242 k Monroe was also briefly hospitalized due to a barbiturate overdose. 245 As she and Greene could not settle their disagreements over MMP Monroe bought his share of the company. 246 Monroe with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot 1959 for which she won a Golden Globe Monroe returned to Hollywood in July 1958 to act opposite Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Billy Wilders comedy on gender roles Some Like It Hot . 247 She considered the role of Sugar Kane another dumb blonde but accepted it due to Millers encouragement and the offer of 10 of the films profits on top of her standard pay. 248 The films difficult production has since become legendary . 249 Monroe demanded dozens of retakes and did not remember her lines or act as directedCurtis famously said that kissing her was like kissing Hitler due to the number of retakes. 250 Monroe privately likened the production to a sinking ship and commented on her co-stars and director saying but why should I worry I have no phallic symbol to lose. 251 Many of the problems stemmed from her and Wilderwho also had a reputation for being difficultdisagreeing on how she should play the role. 252 She angered him by asking to alter many of her scenes which in turn made her stage fright worse and it is suggested that she deliberately ruined several scenes to act them her way. 252 In the end Wilder was happy with Monroes performance saying: Anyone can remember lines but it takes a real artist to come on the set and not know her lines and yet give the performance she did! 253 Some Like It Hot was a critical and commercial success when it was released in March 1959. 254 Monroes performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Leading Role - Musical or Comedy 255 and prompted Variety to call her a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that just cant be beat . 239 256 It has been voted one of the best films ever made in polls by the BBC 257 the American Film Institute 258 and Sight Sound . 259 Monroe with Yves Montand in Lets Make Love 1960 which she agreed to make only to fulfill her contract with Fox 19601962: Career decline and personal difficulties After Some Like It Hot Monroe took another hiatus until late 1959 when she starred in the musical comedy Lets Make Love . 260 She chose George Cukor to direct and Miller rewrote some of the script which she considered weak. She accepted the part solely because she was behind on her contract with Fox. 261 The films production was delayed by her frequent absences from the set. 260 During the shoot Monroe had an affair with co-star Yves Montand that was widely reported by the press and used in the films publicity campaign. 262 Lets Make Love was unsuccessful upon its release in September 1960. 263 Crowther described Monroe as appearing rather untidy and lacking ... the old Monroe dynamism 264 and Hedda Hopper called the film the most vulgar picture shes ever done . 265 Truman Capote lobbied for Monroe to play Holly Golightly in a film adaptation of Breakfast at Tiffanys but the role went to Audrey Hepburn as its producers feared that Monroe would complicate the production. 266 That year Monroe was committed to New York Hospital s Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic . While one report owes it to a suicide attempt another claims that Monroe was feeling overcome with personal issues and telephoned psychoanalyst Marianne Kris who committed her to the ward for exhaustion . 267 268 269 Though Monroe thought she would have a rest cure there her experience there proved to be rather traumatic. Four days after her arrival DiMaggio helped get her released. 267 269 She later detailed her experience to psychiatrist Ralph Greenson : 267 There was no empathy at Payne-Whitney it had a very bad effect they asked me after putting me in a cell I mean cement blocks and all for very disturbed depressed patients except I felt I was in some kind of prison for a crime I hadnt committed. The inhumanity there I found archaic. They asked me why I wasnt happy there everything was under lock and key; things like electric lights dresser drawers bathrooms closets bars concealed on the windows the doors have windows so patients can be visible all the time also the violence and markings still remain on the walls from former patients. I answered: Well Id have to be nuts if I like it here. I sat on the bed trying to figure if I was given this situation in an acting improvisation what would I do. So I figured its a squeaky wheel that gets the grease. I admit it was a loud squeak but I got the idea from a movie I made once called Dont Bother to Knock. I picked up a light-weight chair and slammed it and it was hard to do because I had never broken anything in my lifeagainst the glass intentionally. It took a lot of banging to get even a small piece of glassso I went over with the glass concealed in my hand and sat quietly on the bed waiting for them to come in. They did and I said to them If you are going to treat me like a nut Ill act like a nut. The last film Monroe completed was John Huston s 1961 film The Misfits which Miller had written to provide her with a dramatic role. 270 She played Roslyn Taber 271 a recently divorced woman who becomes friends with her Reno landlady and three aging cowboys played by Clark Gable Eli Wallach and Montgomery Clift . The filming in Reno and in the Nevada desert east of Carson City between July and November 1960 was difficult. 272 As a girl Monroe had thought and hoped that Gable was her father after she saw a photo of one of her mothers exes who had a thin mustache like Gable. 273 274 When Huston wanted to make Roslyn a secondary character instead of a major character Gable fought Huston to assure Roslyns place as a primary character. 275 By the time the movie was finished Monroes and Millers marriage was effectively over. 270 Monroe disliked that he had based her role partly on her life and thought it inferior to the male roles. She also struggled with Millers habit of rewriting scenes the night before filming. 276 Her health was also failing: she was in pain from gallstones and her drug addiction was so severe that her makeup usually had to be applied while she was still asleep under the influence of barbiturates. 277 In August filming was halted for her to spend a week in a hospital detox . 277 Despite her problems Huston said that when Monroe was acting she was not pretending to an emotion. It was the real thing. She would go deep down within herself and find it and bring it up into consciousness. 278 Monroe Estelle Winwood Eli Wallach Montgomery Clift and Clark Gable in The Misfits 1961. The Misfits was the final completed film for Monroe and Gable who both died within two years. Monroe and Miller separated after filming wrapped and she obtained a Mexican divorce in January 1961. 279 The Misfits was released the following month failing at the box office. 280 Its reviews were mixed 280 with Variety complaining of frequently choppy character development 281 and Bosley Crowther calling Monroe completely blank and unfathomable and writing that unfortunately for the films structure everything turns upon her . 282 It has received more favorable reviews in the 21st century. Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute has called it a classic 283 Huston scholar Tony Tracy called Monroes performance the most mature interpretation of her career 284 and Geoffrey McNab of The Independent praised her extraordinary portrayal of the characters power of empathy . 285 Monroe on the set of Somethings Got to Give in May 1962. She was absent for most of the production due to illness and was fired by Fox in June 1962 two months before her death. Monroe was next to star in a television adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham s Rain for NBC but the project fell through as the network did not want to hire her choice of director Lee Strasberg. 286 Instead of working she spent the first six months of 1961 preoccupied by health problems. She underwent a cholecystectomy and surgery for her endometriosis and spent four weeks hospitalized for depression. 287 l She was helped by DiMaggio with whom she rekindled a friendship and dated his friend Frank Sinatra for several months. 289 Monroe also moved permanently back to California in 1961 purchasing a house at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in Brentwood Los Angeles in early 1962. 290 Monroe returned to the public eye in the spring of 1962. She received a World Film Favorite at the 19th Golden Globe Awards and began to shoot a film for Fox Somethings Got to Give a remake of My Favorite Wife 1940. 291 It was to be co-produced by MMP directed by George Cukor and to co-star Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse . 292 Days before filming began Monroe caught sinusitis . Despite medical advice to postpone the production Fox began it as planned in late April. 293 Monroe was too sick to work for most of the next six weeks but despite confirmations by multiple doctors the studio pressured her by alleging publicly that she was faking it. 293 On May 19 she took a break to sing Happy Birthday Mr. President on stage at President John F. Kennedy s early birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in New York. 294 She drew attention with her costume: a beige skintight dress covered in rhinestones which made her appear as if she were nude. 294 m Monroes trip to New York caused even more irritation for Fox executives who had wanted her to cancel it. 296 Monroe next filmed a scene for Somethings Got to Give in which she swam naked in a swimming pool. 297 To generate advance publicity the press was invited to take photographs; these were later published in Life . This was the first time that a major star had posed nude at the height of their career. 298 When she was again on sick leave for several days Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling with the rising costs of Cleopatra 1963. 299 On June 7 Fox fired Monroe and sued her for 750 000 in damages. 300 She was replaced by Lee Remick but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe Fox sued him as well and shut down the production. 301 The studio blamed Monroe for the films demise and began spreading negative publicity about her even alleging that she was mentally disturbed. 300 Fox soon regretted its decision and reopened negotiations with Monroe later in June; a settlement about a new contract including recommencing Somethings Got to Give and a starring role in the black comedy What a Way to Go! 1964 was reached later that summer. 302 She was also planning on starring in a biopic of Jean Harlow . 303 To repair her public image Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures including interviews for Life and Cosmopolitan and her first photo shoot for Vogue . 304 For Vogue she and photographer Bert Stern collaborated for two series of photographs over three days one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude which were published posthumously with the title The Last Sitting . 305 Death and funeral Main article: Death of Marilyn Monroe Monroe third from left with actors on the filming set of The Exterminating Angel during her visit to Mexico in February 1962 one of her last media appearances One of Monroes last photoshoots by George Barris 23 days before her death July 1962 During her final months Monroe lived at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Her housekeeper Eunice Murray was staying overnight at the home on the evening of August 4 1962. 306 Murray woke at 3:00 a.m. on August 5 and sensed that something was wrong. She saw light from under Monroes bedroom door but was unable to get a response and found the door locked. Murray then called Monroes psychiatrist Ralph Greenson who arrived at the house shortly after and broke into the bedroom through a window. He found a nude Monroe dead in her bed covered by a sheet with her hand clamped around a telephone receiver. 306 Monroes physician Hyman Engelberg arrived at around 3:50 a.m. 306 and pronounced her dead. At 4:25 a.m. the Los Angeles Police Department was notified. 306 Monroe died between 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. on August 4; 307 the toxicology report showed that the cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning . She had 8 mg milligrams per 100 milliliters of solution chloral hydrate and 4.5 mg of pentobarbital Nembutal in her blood and 13 mg of pentobarbital in her liver. 308 Empty medicine bottles were found next to her bed. 309 The possibility that Monroe had accidentally overdosed was ruled out because the dosages found in her body were several times the lethal limit. 310 Front page of the New York Mirror on August 6 1962 The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was assisted in their investigation by the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team who had expert knowledge on suicide. 309 Monroes doctors stated that she had been prone to severe fears and frequent depressions with abrupt and unpredictable mood changes and had overdosed several times in the past possibly intentionally. 310 311 Due to these facts and the lack of any indication of foul play deputy coroner Thomas Noguchi classified her death as a probable suicide. 312 However in an interview with ina.fr Monroes older half-sister Berniece Baker Miracle said: I dont think she committed suicide. It could have been an accident because I had just talked to her a short time before. She told me what she had planned to do she had just bought a new house and she was working on the curtains of the windows. She had so many things to look forward to and she was so happy. 68 Monroes sudden death was front-page news in the United States and Europe. 313 According to historian Lois Banner its said that the suicide rate in Los Angeles doubled the month after she died; the circulation rate of most newspapers expanded that month 313 and the Chicago Tribune reported that they had received hundreds of phone calls from members of the public requesting information about her death. 314 French artist Jean Cocteau commented that her death should serve as a terrible lesson to all those whose chief occupation consists of spying on and tormenting film stars her former co-star Laurence Olivier deemed her the complete victim of ballyhoo and sensation and Bus Stop director Joshua Logan said that she was one of the most unappreciated people in the world . 315 Monroes crypt at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood Village Her funeral held at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery on August 8 was private and attended by only her closest associates. 316 The service was arranged by DiMaggio Miracle and Monroes business manager Inez Melson. 316 DiMaggio having claimed her body was the only one of her ex-husbands to attend. 167 317 Monroes mother who was confined to a sanatorium at the time did not attend either as she was not informed her daughter had died. 317 DiMaggio barred the Kennedy family from attending 318 as well as most of Hollywood saying Tell them if it wasnt for them shed still be here. 319 She was adorned in a simple green Emilio Pucci dress and green scarf with baby pink roses and champagne silk lining her twin-bronze casket. 320 321 DiMaggio was distraught at the funeral kissing Monroes body and saying I love you. I love you. 322 Hundreds of spectators crowded the streets around the cemetery. 316 Monroe was later entombed at the Corridor of Memories. 323 For 20 years after her death DiMaggio sent roses to Monroes grave. 322 324 In the following decades several conspiracy theories including murder and accidental overdose have been introduced to contradict suicide as the cause of Monroes death. 325 The speculation that Monroe had been murdered first gained mainstream attention with the publication of Norman Mailer s Marilyn: A Biography in 1973 and in the following years became widespread enough for the Los Angeles County District Attorney John Van de Kamp to conduct a threshold investigation in 1982 to see whether a criminal investigation should be opened. 326 No evidence of foul play was found. 327 Screen persona and reception The 1940s had been the heyday for actresses who were perceived as tough and smartsuch as Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck who had appealed to women-dominated audiences during the war years. 20th Century-Fox wanted Monroe to be a star of the new decade who would draw men to movie theaters and saw her as a replacement for the aging Betty Grable their most popular blonde bombshell of the 1940s. 328 According to film scholar Richard Dyer Monroes star image was crafted mostly for the male gaze . 329 From the beginning Monroe played a significant part in the creation of her public image and towards the end of her career exerted almost full control over it. 330 331 She devised many of her publicity strategies cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as Sidney Skolsky and Louella Parsons and controlled the use of her images. 332 In addition to Grable she was often compared to another well-known blonde 1930s film star Jean Harlow . 333 The comparison was prompted partly by Monroe who named Harlow as her childhood idol wanted to play her in a biopic and even employed Harlows hair stylist to color her hair. 334 Monroes screen persona focused on her blonde hair and the stereotypes that were associated with it especially dumbness naivete sexual availability and artificiality. 335 She often used a breathy childish voice in her films and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was utterly innocent and uncalculated parodying herself with double entendres that came to be known as Monroeisms . 336 For example when she was asked what she had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot she replied I had the radio on . 337 As seen in this publicity photo for The Seven Year Itch 1955 Monroe wore figure-hugging outfits that enhanced her sexual attractiveness. In her films Monroe usually played the beautiful blonde girl who is defined solely by her gender. 329 Her roles were almost always chorus girls secretaries or models: occupations where the woman is on show there for the pleasure of men. 329 Monroe began her career as a pin-up model and was noted for her hourglass figure. 338 She was often positioned in film scenes so that her curvy silhouette was on display and frequently posed like a pin-up in publicity photos. 338 Her distinctive hip-swinging walk also drew attention to her body and earned her the nickname the girl with the horizontal walk . 128 Monroe often wore white to emphasize her blondness and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off her figure. 339 Her publicity stunts often revolved around her clothing either being shockingly revealing or even malfunctioning 340 such as when a shoulder strap of her dress snapped during a press conference. 340 In press stories Monroe was portrayed as the embodiment of the American Dream a girl who had risen from a miserable childhood to Hollywood stardom. 341 Stories of her time spent in foster families and an orphanage were exaggerated and even partly fabricated. 342 Film scholar Thomas Harris wrote that her working-class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually available the ideal playmate in contrast to her contemporary Grace Kelly who was also marketed as an attractive blonde but due to her upper-class background was seen as a sophisticated actress unattainable for the majority of male viewers. 343 Although Monroes screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually attractive blonde was a carefully crafted act audiences and film critics believed it to be her real personality. This became a hindrance when she wanted to pursue other kinds of roles or to be respected as a businesswoman. 344 The academic Sarah Churchwell studied narratives about Monroe and wrote: The biggest myth is that she was dumb. The second is that she was fragile. The third is that she couldnt act. She was far from dumb although she was not formally educated and she was very sensitive about that. But she was very smart indeedand very tough. She had to be both to beat the Hollywood studio system in the 1950s. ... The dumb blonde was a roleshe was an actress for heavens sake! Such a good actress that no one now believes she was anything but what she portrayed on screen. 345 Biographer Lois Banner writes that Monroe often subtly parodied her sex symbol status in her films and public appearances 346 and that the Marilyn Monroe character she created was a brilliant archetype who stands between Mae West and Madonna in the tradition of twentieth-century gender tricksters. 347 Monroe herself stated that she was influenced by West learning a few tricks from herthat impression of laughing at or mocking her own sexuality . 348 She studied comedy in classes by mime and dancer Lotte Goslar famous for her comic stage performances and Goslar also instructed her on film sets. 349 In Gentlemen Prefer Blondes one of the films in which she played an archetypal dumb blonde Monroe had the sentence I can be smart when its important but most men dont like it added to her characters lines. 350 According to Dyer Monroe became virtually a household name for sex in the 1950s and her image has to be situated in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised the Fifties in America such as Freudian ideas about sex the Kinsey report 1953 and Betty Friedan s The Feminine Mystique 1963. 351 By appearing vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal Monroe was the first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger in contrast to the 1940s femmes fatales . 352 Spoto likewise describes her as the embodiment of the postwar ideal of the American girl soft transparently needy worshipful of men naive offering sex without demands which is echoed in Molly Haskell s statement that she was the Fifties fiction the lie that a woman had no sexual needs that she is there to cater to or enhance a mans needs. 353 Monroes contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that Marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others but ice cream with her while Groucho Marx characterized her as Mae West Theda Bara and Bo Peep all rolled into one . 354 According to Haskell due to her sex symbol status Monroe was less popular with women than with men as they couldnt identify with her and didnt support her although this would change after her death. 355 Dyer has also argued that Monroes blonde hair became her defining feature because it made her racially unambiguous and exclusively white just as the civil rights movement was beginning and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century popular culture. 356 Banner agreed that it may not be a coincidence that Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the civil rights movement but has also criticized Dyer pointing out that in her highly publicized private life Monroe associated with people who were seen as white ethnics such as Joe DiMaggio Italian-American and Arthur Miller Jewish. 357 According to Banner she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example in an image featured in Look in 1951 she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with African-American singing coach Phil Moore . 358 Monroe in a 1953 Lustre-Creme shampoo advertisement Monroe was perceived as a specifically American star a national institution as well known as hot dogs apple pie or baseball according to Photoplay . 359 Banner calls her the symbol of populuxe a star whose joyful and glamorous public image helped the nation cope with its paranoia in the 1950s about the Cold War the atom bomb and the totalitarian communist Soviet Union . 360 Historian Fiona Handyside writes that the French female audiences associated whitenessblondness with American modernity and cleanliness and so Monroe came to symbolize a modern liberated woman whose life takes place in the public sphere. 361 Film historian Laura Mulvey has written of her as an endorsement for American consumer culture: If America was to export the democracy of glamour into post-war impoverished Europe the movies could be its shop window ... Marilyn Monroe with her all American attributes and streamlined sexuality came to epitomise in a single image this complex interface of the economic the political and the erotic. By the mid-1950s she stood for a brand of classless glamour available to anyone using American cosmetics nylons and peroxide. 362 Twentieth Century-Fox further profited from Monroes popularity by cultivating several lookalike actresses such as Jayne Mansfield and Sheree North . 363 Other studios also attempted to create their own Monroes: Universal Pictures with Mamie Van Doren 364 Columbia Pictures with Kim Novak 365 and The Rank Organization with Diana Dors . 366 In a profile Truman Capote quoted Monroes acting teacher Constance Collier : She is a beautiful child. I dont mean that in the obvious waythe perhaps too obvious way. I dont think shes an actress at all not in any traditional sense. What she hasthis presence this luminosity this flickering intelligencecould never surface on the stage. Its so fragile and subtle it can only be caught by the camera. Its like a hummingbird in flight: only a camera can freeze the poetry of it. 367 Filmography Main article: Marilyn Monroe performances and awards Dangerous Years 1947 Scudda Hoo!

One of the most iconic photos of Monroe it was the basis for Andy Warhol s 1962 silkscreen painting Marilyn Diptych . According to The Guide to United States Popular Culture as an icon of American popular culture Monroes few rivals in popularity include Elvis Presley and Mickey Mouse ... no other star has ever inspired such a wide range of emotionsfrom lust to pity from envy to remorse. 368 Art historian Gail Levin stated that Monroe may have been the most photographed person of the 20th century 136 and The American Film Institute has named her the sixth greatest female screen legend in American film history . The Smithsonian Institution has included her on their list of 100 Most Significant Americans of All Time 369 and both Variety and VH1 have placed her in the top ten in their rankings of the greatest popular culture icons of the twentieth century. 370 371 Hundreds of books have been written about Monroe. She has been the subject of numerous films plays operas and songs and has influenced artists and entertainers such as Andy Warhol and Madonna . 372 373 She also remains a valuable brand: 374 her image and name have been licensed for hundreds of products and she has been featured in advertising for brands such as Max Factor Chanel Mercedes-Benz and Absolut Vodka . 375 376 Monroe in a Photoplay magazine cover photo December 1953 Monroes enduring popularity is tied to her conflicted public image. 377 On the one hand she remains a sex symbol beauty icon and one of the most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema . 378 379 380 On the other she is also remembered for her troubled private life unstable childhood struggle for professional respect as well as her death and the conspiracy theories that surrounded it. 381 She has been written about by scholars and journalists who are interested in gender and feminism; 382 these writers include Gloria Steinem Jacqueline Rose 383 Molly Haskell 384 Sarah Churchwell 376 and Lois Banner. 385 Some such as Steinem have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. 382 386 Others such as Haskell 387 Rose 383 and Churchwell 376 have instead stressed Monroes proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona. Left panel from pop artist James Gill s painting Marilyn Triptych 1962 Owing to the contrast between her stardom and troubled private life Monroe is closely linked to broader discussions about modern phenomena such as mass media fame and consumer culture. 388 According to academic Susanne Hamscha Monroe has continued relevance to ongoing discussions about modern society and she is never completely situated in one time or place but has become a surface on which narratives of American culture can be reconstructed and functions as a cultural type that can be reproduced transformed translated into new contexts and enacted by other people . 388 Similarly Banner has called Monroe the eternal shapeshifter who is re-created by each generation even each individual... to their own specifications . 389 Monroe remains a cultural icon but critics are divided on her legacy as an actress. David Thomson called her body of work insubstantial 390 and Pauline Kael wrote that she could not act but rather used her lack of an actresss skills to amuse the public. She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into actingand vice versa; she did what others had the good taste not to do . 391 In contrast Peter Bradshaw wrote that Monroe was a talented comedian who understood how comedy achieved its effects 392 and Roger Ebert wrote that Monroes eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what they got back on the screen was magical . 393 Similarly Jonathan Rosenbaum stated that she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material and that the difficulty some people have discerning Monroes intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era when super feminine women werent supposed to be smart . 394 In 2024 the Los Angeles City Council approved Monroes house in Brentwood Los Angeles being designated as a Historic Cultural Monument. 395 Notes Monroe had her screen name made into her legal name in early 1956. 4 5 Gladys named Mortensen as Monroes father in the birth certificate although the name was misspelled 15 but it is unlikely that he was the father as their separation had taken place well before she became pregnant. 16 Biographers Fred Guiles and Lois Banner stated that her father was likely Charles Stanley Gifford Gladyss superior at RKO Studios with whom she had an affair in 1925 17 whereas Donald Spoto thought that another co-worker was probably the father. 18 Monroe spoke about being sexually abused by a lodger when she was eight years old to her biographers Ben Hecht in 19531954 and Maurice Zolotow in 1960 and in interviews for Paris Match and Cosmopolitan . 33 Although she refused to name the abuser Banner believes he was George Atkinson as he was a lodger and fostered Monroe when she was eight; Banner also states that Monroes description of the abuser fits other descriptions of Atkinson. 34 Banner has argued that the abuse may have been a major causative factor in Monroes mental health problems and has also written that as the subject was taboo in mid-century United States Monroe was unusual in daring to speak about it publicly. 35 Spoto does not mention the incident but states that Monroe was sexually abused by Graces husband in 1937 and by a cousin while living with a relative in 1938. 36 Barbara Leaming repeats Monroes account of the abuse but earlier biographers Fred Guiles Anthony Summers and Carl Rollyson have doubted the incident owing to lack of evidence beyond Monroes statements. 37 RKOs owner Howard Hughes had expressed an interest in Monroe after seeing her on a magazine cover. 80 It has sometimes been claimed that Monroe appeared as an extra in other Fox films during this period including Green Grass of Wyoming The Shocking Miss Pilgrim and You Were Meant For Me but there is no evidence to support this. 89 Baumgarth was initially not happy with the photos but published one of them in 1950; Monroe was not publicly identified as the model until 1952. Although she then contained the resulting scandal by claiming she had reluctantly posed nude due to an urgent need for cash biographers Spoto and Banner have stated that she was not pressured although according to Banner she was initially hesitant due to her aspirations of movie stardom and regarded the shoot as simply another work assignment. 101 In addition to All About Eve and The Asphalt Jungle Monroes 1950 films were Love Happy A Ticket to Tomahawk Right Cross and The Fireball . Monroe also had a role in Home Town Story released in 1951. Monroe and Greene had first met and had a brief affair in 1949 and met again in 1953 when he photographed her for Look . She told him about her grievances with the studio and Greene suggested that they start their own production company. 199 Monroe underwent psychoanalysis regularly from 1955 until her death. Her analysts were psychiatrists Margaret Hohenberg 195557 Anna Freud 1957 Marianne Kris 195761 and Ralph Greenson 196062. 207 Monroe identified with the Jewish people as a dispossessed group and wanted to convert to make herself part of Millers family. 227 She was instructed by Rabbi Robert Goldberg and converted on July 1 1956. 226 Monroes interest in Judaism as a religion was limited: she called herself a Jewish atheist and did not practice the faith after divorcing Miller aside from retaining some religious items. 226 Egypt also lifted her ban after the divorce was finalized in 1961. 226 Endometriosis also caused her to experience severe menstrual pain throughout her life necessitating a clause in her contract allowing her to be absent from work during her period; her endometriosis also required several surgeries. 242 It has sometimes been alleged that Monroe underwent several abortions and that unsafe abortions made by persons without proper medical training would have contributed to her inability to maintain a pregnancy. 243 The abortion rumors began from statements made by Amy Greene the wife of Milton Greene but have not been confirmed by any concrete evidence. 244 Furthermore Monroes autopsy report did not note any evidence of abortions. 244 Monroe first admitted herself to the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic in New York at the suggestion of her psychiatrist Marianne Kris. 288 Kris later stated that her choice of hospital was a mistake: Monroe was placed on a ward meant for severely mentally ill people with psychosis where she was locked in a padded cell and not allowed to move to a more suitable ward or leave the hospital. 288 Monroe was finally able to leave the hospital after three days with the help of Joe DiMaggio and moved to the Columbia University Medical Center spending a further 23 days there. 288 Monroe and Kennedy had mutual friends and were familiar with each other. Although they sometimes had casual sexual encounters there is no evidence that their relationship was serious. 295 References Hertel Howard; Heff Don August 6 1962.
